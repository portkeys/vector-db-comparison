    "body_content": "The Ironman World Championship has got to be the dumbest sporting event in the world.\nIf you can survive a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike, and marathon run in the suffocating heat and humidity of Hawaii, you’ve figured out endurance sport. If you can win the race, you are cutting the edge of it.\nAt the women’s 2025 Ironman World Championship in Kona on Saturday, some of the world’s best did not survive. (In the metaphorical sense, anyway, they are all OK.)\n“We came close to a line you never want to cross,” Reece Charles-Barclay said after pulling his wife, Lucy, off the course—as she led the race—at mile 17. That put Taylor Knibb out ahead, and just two miles from the finish she got carted off the course in an ambulance.\nThis brings us to why I’m ranting about triathlon in a running publication. For the past several years, I’ve had the honor of joining our sister publication, Triathlete Magazine, to report on this absurdity. Now that I’m revealing my cynicism, they may never invite me back. But in triathlon’s defense, the incessant boundary pushing at this event makes it particularly instructive for us runners. If high-carb fueling and those cooling headbands that look like medieval crowns are any indication, triathlon is consistently three to five years ahead of running.\nAnd there’s something the very best Ironman athletes in the world are doing right now that we need to adopt immediately.\nWhich brings us back to Saturday. As Kona brought some of the best of the best to their knees, quite literally, Norway’s Solveig Løvseth patiently, persistently emerged through the soggy ashes to win the thing in her debut.\nNorway&#8217;s Solveig Løseth rose above the mutually-assured self-destruction ahead of her to win the 2025 Ironman World Championship in her debut.  (Photo: Brad Kaminski/Triathlete)\nIf that sounds familiar, it’s because countryman Casper Stornes won the men’s race last month in Nice, France (also on his debut) in a Norwegian podium sweep with his training partners Gustav Iden and Kristian Blummenfelt—who also won the Ironman World Championship on their debuts.\nOne does not simply win the Ironman World Championship in one&#8217;s debut. And four wins in four debuts is an unprecedented achievement for any country, much less for one of 5.6 million—300,000 fewer people than the state of Colorado.\nCoincidence? No, it’s the Norwegian Method! you may assume, if you’ve been remotely paying attention to endurance training theory over the past half a decade. And, from what I’ve learned picking these superstar brains, you would be right—but not exactly in the way you think.\nThe Secret to the Norwegian Method\nIt’s true the Norwegians, particularly in the sport of triathlon, have pioneered high volume, low-to-moderate intensity training guided by lactate testing with a meticulous focus on marginal gains through modalities like heat training. Ignoring this “Norwegian Method” and its massive contributions to sport, and to these athletes’ success, would be negligent.\nBut there’s another variable at play that doesn’t get talked about much.\nTriathletes are notoriously uptight and reserved. (I’m allowed to say this because I used to be one.) And it makes sense: it takes a Type-A personality to have the organization and discipline to train for three sports at once. A sport that requires 20 to 35 hours of training a week, much of it staring at the black line at the bottom of the pool and the white line on the side of the road, just begs for loners, introverts, and those with a few loose screws.\nSo I was a bit shocked when, after landing in Kona last year, we drove to Iden and Blummenfelt’s condo to shoot their bikes. Typically at these things, we’re greeted by a manager or a tech rep. This time, the boys opened the door in flip-flops and giant smiles. Iden invited me to run around in his far too big, futuristic-looking super shoes, and we caught them trash-talking each other on camera.\nBest friends and training partners Kristian Blummenfelt, Casper Stornes, and Gustav Iden of Norway at the start line of the 2025 Ironman World Championship. They finished 3-1-2, respectively.  (Photo: Jan Hetfleisch/Getty Images for Ironman)\nThe Norwegians bring a seldom-seen lightness to the sport. At the men’s Ironman World Championship pre-race press conference this year, Iden said it was a good thing Stornes wasn’t there because “he says a lot of stupid things. So I think it’s better for him to just not open his mouth sometimes.”\nThe joke had a particularly big payoff when, at the post-race press conference, I asked Stornes what stupid things he would have said, and he looked at me like a deer in the headlights.\nIden and Blummenfelt were equally coy when we asked them about what’s next on the training frontier. Blummenfelt banged on about pine bark or something, and Iden insisted it’s track spikes.\nAfter spraying the champagne non-alcoholic beer on the podium in Kona, Løvseth confirmed what we could all see:\n“They’re really serious in their training, but they have a surprisingly relaxed attitude,” she said. “That’s a much more fun way to live the triathlon life.”\nThe Fun Factor\nYou can&#8217;t make it up: Gustav Iden, Kristian Blummenfelt, and Casper Stornes lead the 2025 Ironman World Championship on September 14, 2025 in Nice, France. (Photo: Jan Hetfleisch/Getty Images for Ironman)\nThe Norwegian men have inspired Løseth in many more ways than one, she told me. They all grew up racing on the Norwegian national team, learning from some of the sharpest minds in the sport, including Arild Tveiten and Olav Aleksander Bu. Watching Iden win the world championship in 2021 piqued her interest in long-course triathlon. And seeing Stornes storm to victory a month ago gave her the confidence that she, too, could do well.\nSeeing is believing, and there’s an intangible power to being swept up in the momentum of success. But here’s the part about triathlon, and endurance sport more generally, that’s easy to overlook from the sidelines: It’s hard, and often, it’s not fun. Not in the slightest.\nI’m not even talking about the racing. I’m talking about the daily grind of two to three workouts a day, being tired all the time, and living hermetically to optimize whatever slim recovery windows you can find.\nIt’s just as easy to burn out mentally in this sport as it is to fry yourself physically. So cracking the code to having fun is a cheat code to success. Consider what Løvseth, who finished a disappointing 48th at the Olympics last summer, said to me with her Kona champion’s lei still on her head:\n“I had a lot of fun in training camp going into this race,” she said. “Of course, training well, but also having a lot of fun. I’ve never been less stressed on race morning.”\nCarbs, Culture, Community\n“Just have fun” is obviously easier said than done—like “just fall asleep.” That brings us back to the Norwegian men and what Stornes said to me after his victory in Nice:\n“Gustav and Kristian are, outside of triathlon, my best friends. They have been carrying me for basically every session also.”\nWhen they weren’t at home in Bergen, Norway, the three Norse Stooges spent extended periods of time together on high-altitude training camps in the Pyrenees, reconning the course in Nice, and traveling around the planet from Woodlands, Texas, to Frankfurt, Germany, for races.\nThis year, the one with the highest ranking in the Ironman Pro Series gets to pick their bedroom in the Airbnb first, Blummenfelt said with a glint in his eye. (Likely because at the time, he was in the lead.) Their careers as professional triathletes are equally as much lives shared with friends.\nI’ve been reflecting on this a lot with my own running this year as I train for my first road marathon. Marathon training is objectively not as fun as running on the trails, which I’ve been doing for the better part of a decade. It’s been a lot of time on the side of busy roads, hitting splits, failing to hit splits, and saying no to mountain adventures to maximize recovery on the flats. And yet, I’ve been having more fun with my running than maybe ever. Why?\n[instagram src=https://www.instagram.com/p/DPPBR4LD7Qe/]\nIt’s pretty simple, I think: I joined a running team at the start of the year. Suddenly, I look forward to workout days because it means socializing at sunrise. I don’t have to hype myself up to get out the door. I have people to push me and hold me back as needed. I have friends cheering for me during track intervals, and I have the distraction and mental boost of cheering for them. Running isn’t just about running. It’s about camaraderie, connection, something bigger than myself.\nStornes shared a similar sentiment. He left the Norwegian national team at the beginning of the year to train with Iden and Blummenfelt, who all self-coach themselves and each other.\n“It’s a good competition in the group, that we are building each other up and giving each other advice,” he said. “For us, it’s working very well.”\nIden, who’s been building back after his mother passed away in the spring of 2023, agreed.\n“The journey over the past two years has been insane. Many thanks to Casper and Kristian, who honestly have carried me through whole sessions,” Iden said. “I have been there and done the work myself, but they’ve been there and they’ve made me work for it very hard.”\n“Follow Your Bliss”\nFor Courtney Dauwalter, having fun includes enormous renovations of her pain cave, like at the 2025 UTMB where she finished 10th. (Photo: Peter Maksimow)\nSince joining a running team, I feel less self-imposed pressure on reaching external goals, because hitting those goals isn’t the point. The point is the process of working towards them, because the process is so fun.\nAnd, ultimately, as we’ve seen with the Norwegians, if you’re having fun, you’re mentally freed to get the most out of yourself and reach those goals anyway.\nI don’t think it’s a coincidence that some of the most cutting-edge runners are also jumping on the fun train. Courtney Dauwalter, while notoriously secretive about her training, has been beating the Fun Drum since the beginning.\n“You work hard, you give everything you’ve got, you don’t forget to have fun,” Dauwalter told us last year.\n“Fun” doesn’t look the same for everyone. For Dauwalter, it means baggy shorts, candy, and nachos, yes, but also seeking challenges that push her to the brink.\n“I think things can be fun and painful at the same time,” she said. “I think having fun doesn’t have to look like laughing and smiling the whole time. When I’m in the pain cave, that’s fun for me. Exploring that is really cool.”\nTom Evans embraces his wife and triathlete, Sophie, and baby daughter, Phoebe, after winning the 2025 Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc (UTMB). (Photo: Jacob Zocherman)\nThis theme came up again in August, when Tom Evans won UTMB after DNFing in 2023 and 2024. Sure, he and coach Scott Johnston tweaked his training. But the biggest change, Evans said, was his mindset.\n“Genuinely, my goals today weren’t to win,” Evans said at the finish line. “My goals today were to look at myself in the mirror and be proud of what I achieved.”\nIn practice, that means, well, you guessed it:\n“I believe you have to have fun with it,” Evans said. “Having fun will make you regular, and being regular will make you good. If you can get out and run every day because you like what you’re doing, that’ll make you a good runner. Follow your bliss.”",

    "body_content": "Backpackers are good at improvising creative solutions to problems, especially when it comes to gear. When you’re carrying your life on your back, relying on quick fixes and DIY systems is the name of the game. We also love gadgets and any piece of gear that simplifies time spent on the trail or in camp. So it’s no surprise that the internet abounds with 3D-printed models, designed by hikers, aiming to solve all kinds of backpacking dilemmas. While we haven’t yet tested any of the following, here are 10 designs we think deserve a place in our backpacks.\nDon’t have a 3D printer at home? Many libraries, makers workshops, and other creative spaces have printers available for use by the public.\nCord Tensioners\nSure, a taut line hitch will do when it comes to perfecting our tent pitch or hanging a clothesline, but we love cord tensioners that automatically lock into place when you slide them along a line—no tying required. Some tent and tarp guylines come pre-fitted with tensioning devices, but you can retrofit all of your lines and shelters with this handy design.\nBear Canister Key\nA 3D-printed bear canister key (top) and stake pusher (bottom). (Photo: Andrew Hall)\nEver tried to open a BearVault with freezing fingers? Fumbling with the plastic nubs can be painful and frustrating. Thankfully, one ingenious backpacker designed this key to aid in the process. You could use a credit card, but this device even comes with an attachment for your canister’s lid so it’s always on hand.\nPocket-Sized Games\nCard games are fun, but who says your favorite board games can’t be ultralight? Only a smidge larger than a Snickers bar (but you can scale the design to any size you like), this teeny-tiny chess set is compact and packable. This Connect 4 set fits inside an Altoid tin. Whatever game you love, there’s likely a mini 3D-printed model out there.\nToothpaste Transfer Tube\nA way to make our mini toothpaste tubes reusable? Count us in. (Photo: VisualStories/Getty Images)\nOunce-counters love sample-size mini toothpaste tubes (the ones that are even smaller than travel-sized toothpaste). But buying a new tube for every hike is wasteful. One resourceful backpacker invented this coupler for refilling miniature toothpaste tubes from full-sized ones.\nTwo-in-One Whistle/Tick Remover\nUltralighters love any item that serves multiple functions. There are countless designs for tick-removal tools and safety whistles online, but this model combines the two into one keychain-compatible gizmo.\nFuel Stand\nSome backpacking stoves come with fuel canister stands to keep your whole setup level on uneven ground. If yours didn’t, you can print your own foldable stand with this model. If you’ve got an engineer’s mind, you can modify the design to suit your needs.\nStake Pushers\nSharp stake ends causing damage to your palms or shoes? You need a 3D-printed stake pusher.\nI’ve bent and broken countless tent stakes by hammering them with a large rock, but never have I considered that there may be a solution out there. These stake-pushing devices fit on top of a tent stake (there are loads of designs to fit different shapes and sizes) to protect your hand or shoe while driving the stake, or provide a flat surface upon which to hammer.\nTrekking Pole Tip Protectors\nLast time I had to pack my trekking poles into checked luggage, I wrapped the tips in paper towels to prevent them from damaging my bag or anything inside it. Instead, you can print tip caps, rubber feet, and even replacement baskets for your poles. There are plenty of designs compatible with various models and brands so you can find your perfect fit.\nWater Filter End Cap\nHere’s a really niche one. Picture this: You’re expecting a cold night in camp, and you don’t want your water filter to freeze. The solution? Put it in your sleeping bag. But residual water can leak out while you sleep. Why use a plastic bag when you can simply screw on this end cap, specifically designed for Sawyer water filters? Just like that, no more leaks.\nSleeping Pad Pump Adapter\nBattery-powered sleeping pad pumps are among our favorite recent backpacking innovations. But these pumps aren’t compatible with every brand of sleeping pad on the market. Luckily, a handful of 3D-print models exist for adapting pumps for specific sleeping pads.",

    "body_content": "Spooky season is upon us, and though I am an all-season hiker, the woods call out to me much louder the colder and darker it gets, especially leading up to Halloween. I hit the road to explore some of the scariest treks on my coastline, and learned from ghost hunters and brave hikers, to compile a list of seriously bone-chilling climbs nationwide.\nFrom the Witch&#8217;s Castle in Oregon, to Zombie Trail in Missouri, and Maiden Cliff in Maine, each site has a story.\nWest Coast Haunted Hikes\nThe West Coast holds trails with secrets, sites where there is blood in the soil, and land claimed to hold trapped souls. Some of the stories you&#8217;re about to read are historically documented, others are not. Here are the three most talked about on the West Coast.\nIron Goat Trail (Granite Falls, Washington)\nSpecs: Iron Goat Trail is a nearly 6-mile loop with just under 1,000 feet in elevation gain rated intermediate on TrailForks, near Mount Baker in the Snoqualmie National Forest. Most of the trail is easy, but there are some steep switchbacks toward the beginning or end of the loop, depending on where you choose to begin. Check out passes and permits info before you go.\nThe story:  In 1910, nearly 100 people traveling through the Cascade Mountains in a passenger train became trapped in a deadly storm. A bolt of lightning sent snow cascading down on them, killing almost everyone inside. A survivor described it as “white death moving down the mountainside,&#8221; according to NPR.\nGoat Trail follows the Great Northern Railway and the remains of the original Cascade Tunnel, just off Highway 2 on Stevens Pass. Hikers claim to feel on edge traveling through, like they are being watched or followed by death.\n“Whenever I’m hiking through that old concrete snowshed I always think about what happened there in 1910,” Tom Davis, a trails coordinator for the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, told the Seattle Times. “Just to me. It’s a little spooky.”\n&#8220;I got an extremely uneasy feeling the whole hike,&#8221; one hiker said on a Reddit thread discussing the spookiest places in Washington State.\n&#8220;It was absolutely one of the creepiest hikes I&#8217;ve done,&#8221; another hiker wrote on the platform. &#8220;Our experienced trail dogs picked up and alerted on something at a few points&#8230;The whole trail felt oppressive, it felt like something was watching us.&#8221;\nWhat else is spooky about Granite Falls? While in town, check out the Granite Falls Historic Museum, rumored to be a paranormal hot spot, too.\nThe Witch&#8217;s Castle (Portland, Oregon)\nThe Witch&#8217;s Castle in Portland, Oregon (Photo: Emilee Coblentz)\nSpecs: It&#8217;s only about a mile-long trek out to the Witch&#8217;s Castle and back from Wildwood trailhead, with just a couple hundred feet of elevation gain. But if you continue on past the castle located in Forest Park, there are multiple trails that can be accessed from it. Each loop takes two to three hours each, moderate, and offers incredible panoramic views of Portland, Oregon, like the trek up to Pittock Mansion. Park entrance is free.\nThe story:  The abandoned castle found on Wildwood trail was once a ranger&#8217;s station and hiker&#8217;s restroom. Built in the 1930s, it was destroyed in the sixties after a huge storm rolled in on Columbus Day. The city decided against repairs and it soon became a popular spot for teenage hangouts, but also, a place where practicing witches perform magic and rituals (which I witnessed first hand).\nBefore the city owned the land, it belonged to the Balch family, who in the mid-1800s, hired a man named Mortimer Stump to help clear out the forest around their homestead. Stump fell in love with one of Danford Balch&#8217;s daughters, and asked for her hand in marriage. Danford refused, threatening to kill the man if he continued to see his daughter. The relationship didn&#8217;t end, so Danford shot Mortimer in the face with a double barrel shotgun. Danford became the first man to be legally executed in the state, for committing the murder.\nOn forums, hikers have discussed experiencing unusual energy, seen floating lights, or 19th century shadowy figures crying out in the night. Portland ghost hunters report that both Danford and Mortimer haunt the land, or the ghost of Mary Jane, Mrs. Blach, who has been deemed the Witch of the house.\nWhat else is spooky about Portland? Well, a lot is spooky about Portland, but check out the Shanghai Tunnels under the Merchant Hotel, dubbed one of the most haunted places in America and featured on The Travel Channel. Tickets are $38 a person. Tours run all the time.\nTesemini Trail (Spirit Lake, Idaho)\nTesemini Trail in Spirit Lake, Idaho  (Photo: Emilee Coblentz)\nSpecs: This 3.5 mile out-and-back in Spirit Lake, Idaho, is breathtaking for more reasons than one. Tesemini Trail may be difficult to find, but it&#8217;s easy to trek, with continual lake views and just under 400 feet in elevation gain. When your GPS pings for you to stop, trust it. The turnoff to the trailhead looks like someone&#8217;s private driveway, but shortly after you make the turn, you&#8217;ll see the Inland Empire sign, advising you about the trail. Day passes should be purchased  before you go.\nThe story: The city of Spirit Lake published the legend of its waters, stating that Hyas-Tyee-Skookum-Tum-Tum (Good Chieftains) of the Kootenai Tribe had a daughter, Hya-Pam (Fearless Running Water), who loved a Kootenai Brave, Hasht-Eel-Ame-Hoom (Shining Eagle). The leader of a neighboring tribe wanted Hya-Pam&#8217;s hand in marriage, so to avoid war, her father agreed. Hearing the news, she and her Brave bound themselves together and leapt into the lake from a spot locally known as &#8220;Suicide Cliff.&#8221; Their bodies were never found, but locals and visitors, alike, say that when the wind is still and the moon bright, the couple&#8217;s shadowy figures can be seen drifting across the lake in a phantom canoe. In the spring, it is said that their cries can be heard as the ice melts and their spirits are released.\nWhat else is spooky about Spirit Lake? Rathdrum Mountain Park and Hoodooo Mountain are known for paranormal activity. Hike Rathdrum Mountain Trail for an insane view of the Coeur d&#8217;Alene Mountains, or take the short trek up to Slate Creek Hot Springs, adjacent to Hoodoo Mountain.\nMountain States Haunted Hikes\nThere are just as many eery tales coming from trails winding through the Mountain States. From abandoned towns to grown over cemeteries, these spots will give you a thrill.\nGarnet Ghost Town (Drummond, Montana)\nGarnet Ghost Town (Photo: Wikipedia)\nSpecs: Garnet Ghost Town in Drummon, Montana, has a 3-mile out and back trail easy to complete with nearly 500 feet of elevation gain. During your trek, you will pass two abandoned mineshafts, throwing you back in time to when the town was bustling during the Gold Rush. Visiting requires a permit.\nThe story: One thousand people lived in Garnet in the 1890s, most mining for gold. It took only two decades for the town to be abandoned after the gold dried up, but it remained well preserved. In the early 2000s, the Huffington Post published a story about Garnet, stating that the Department of the Interior was looking for folks to repopulate the town. Those interested in moving would receive a furnished cabin and a food stipend. The phone rang off the hook for weeks.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s primitive, to say the least,&#8221; ranger Nacoma Gainan told the Montana Standard in an article about the opportunity. &#8220;It&#8217;s for people who love the outdoors and want to give back. There&#8217;s no electricity, no Wi-Fi, and no running water. But there are trails to explore, artifacts to inspect. Volunteers are really left to their own devices after the visitors are gone.&#8221;\nEllen Baumler, a Montana Historical Society ghost specialist, and author, famously wrote this about the salon in the center of town: &#8220;Late at night, the spirits of Garnet come out to play in the moonlight. Sometimes, in the deep winter quiet, a piano tinkles in Kelley&#8217;s Saloon, and the spirits dance to ghostly music. Men&#8217;s voices echo in the empty rooms. But the moment a living, human hand touches the building, the noises stop.&#8221;\nAnyone can step back in time and visit today. The visitor center remains open and two cabin rentals are available December through April by calling the Missoula Field Office BLM.\nWhat else is spooky about Drummond? Montana is the place to be if you&#8217;re a ghost hunter, and the state is known for its guided tours. Field of Screams, Unseen Missoula, and ghost tours at the Conrad Mansion are a few of the most popular.\nTransept Trail (The Grand Canyon, Arizona)\nSpecs: Transept Trail is located in the Grand Canyon and is just under 4 miles of trail with about 4oo feet of elevation gain. The route connects Grand Canyon Lodge to the North Rim Campground. You&#8217;ll hike alongside of a canyon most of the climb, and pass through an ancestral Puebloan ruin halfway through. If you&#8217;re hiking as the sun goes down, you may hear who locals call the wailing woman.\nThe story: The story of the wailing woman is the most famous ghost story in the history of the Grand Canyon, Outside previously reported. The legend goes that a young woman was traveling through with her husband and son shortly after Grand Canyon Lodge was built in 1928. Her husband and son went for a hike on what is now Transept Trail without her and were caught in a storm. The man and boy died, and the mother, reported to have been dressed in a white dress with blue flowers on it, ended her life in the lodge when she learned of their deaths.\nHikers have reported hearing her wail along the trail, while others say they’ve actually seen her ghost, dressed in a white dress with blue flowers. The original lodge burned to the ground in 1932. Some witnesses reported seeing her in the flames.\nWhat else is spooky about The Grand Canyon? Hikers say Spooky Canyon, a 2.9-mile loop in the Grand Canyon, gives off spooky vibes. The route winds around the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, known for its narrow, dark slot canyons, according to Gaia. \nVillage Walk (Golden, Colorado)\nSpecs: Village Walk Trail is just about a mile out and back with not even 200 feet of an elevation gain, but it connects to Village Ride Trail to form a loop, which is just as long. Settled just outside of the town of Golden, hikers can catch an eery glimpse of the Mount Vernon House, one of two remaining structures in the area, along with the ruins of Mount Vernon cemetery.\nThe story: Mount Vernon was one of Colorado&#8217;s first settlements. There are only a few headstones left standing in the ruins of its cemetery, but that doesn&#8217;t take from the fright. Mount Vernon is a popular place for hiking, jogging, and mountain biking, but it is also a place whispered to be haunted by the bodies of those now without graves.\nWhat else is spooky about Golden? Visitors can join a two-hour tour of the town of Golden nearby, that holds its own dark past, including stories of murder and an annual &#8220;Night of Terror.&#8221;\nMidwest/Central Haunted Hikes\nHorror documentaries have hailed from the midwestern and central states. There are stories of Zombie trails that host a &#8220;shadow nest&#8221; of ghost children, and hauntings of cave dwellers who lived and died long ago in the same woods. Here are two of the most frightening trails (and tales).\nZombie Trail (Wildwood, Missouri)\nSpecs: Zombie Trail located in Rock Hollow Park near Wildwood, Missouri is a 5.2-mile out-and-back trail with about a 500-foot elevation gain. It was first used by Native Americans to cross the Meramec River, and saw heavy foot traffic during the Civil War. The path was greatly destroyed over time and nicknamed the &#8220;Zombie Road&#8221; in the eighties. There have been unexplained accidents happening ever since.\nThe story: Hikers have described experiencing dread on Zombie Trail and hearing cries, most commonly of what resembles an old woman. Multiple deaths have been documented in the area, mostly of workers experiencing accidents. Some hikers claim to have seen shadowy figures and blue light, and there was a horror documentary released in 2007 by the Booth Brothers called Children of the Grave that aims to show a &#8220;shadow nest&#8221; of ghost children still haunting the woods.\nWhat else is spooky about Wildwood? Just outside of Wildwood is Eureka Fear Farm dubbed &#8220;The Field of Nightmares&#8221; by visitors. The guided haunted trail experience is just under an hour with &#8220;scare zones&#8221; that cause visitors to never return. General admission is $30.\nOld Man&#8217;s Cave Trail (Logan, Ohio)\nSpecs: Old Man&#8217;s Cave Trail to Naturalist Cabin is a mile-long loop in Hocking Hills State Park named to honor an early Ohioan who lived in one of the caves. During the hike, you will see multiple waterfalls and stunning sandstone cliffs. There are staircases leading in and out of a gorge, so wear boots with strong traction and be ready for some mud.\nThe story: Richard Rowe, the mentioned cave dweller and an early settler of the town, died via a gun accident near the cave. The spot he was buried in was never marked. Hikers have mentioned seeing the ghost of the old man and his hound dogs ever since.\nWhat else is spooky about Logan? Visitors can explore Moonville Tunnel, a tourist attraction near Logan believed to contain the ghosts of railroad workers struck down by a train in the tunnel in 1859. Portions of the railroad line can be hiked and biked today. Visitors say they can sometimes see the lanterns of those who have gone on, flickering through the tunnel.\nSouthern Haunted Hikes\nThe South, the birthplace of Voodoo and witchcraft in America, hosts many historical sites with dark pasts and present glooms. From the revenge of a Voodoo priestess to what is known as the top of the Devil&#8217;s Throne, the veil seems to be thin there when venturing out into the woods.\nManchac &#8220;Ghost Swamp&#8221; (Ponchatoula, Louisiana)\nSpecs: Though there is a dirt trail along the Manchac &#8220;Ghost Swamp,&#8221; paddling the five miles out and back through eery marshlands is the spook you&#8217;re looking for. You&#8217;ll find the Manchac Wetlands northwest of New Orleans. Paddling through the dense forest, twilight travelers have recorded hearing unidentifiable sounds.\nThe story: The legend of Manchac Swamp is well-known in the South. The story begins in 1915 with the death of Julia Brown, who was a voodoo priestess in her town of Finner, which no longer exists today. Brown perished in a Category 4 hurricane after prophesying that she would die and take everyone in the town with her. Generation after generation, nearby residents believe her spirit, and the spirits that worked with her, haunt the swamp. The only thing on the island today is a mass grave where the dead are buried. Both a 2009 A&amp;E special, Extreme Paranormal, and a 2013 SyFy series, Haunted Highway, seem to catch paranormal activity emerging from the swamp.\nWhat else is spooky about Ponchatoula? The Destrehan Plantation Haunted Tour, nearby, is an attraction that most people can&#8217;t tell is manufactured. Tickets are $69 a person.\nGhost Loop Trail (Maynardville, Tennessee)\nSpecs: Ghost Loop Trail located in Maynardville, Tennessee, is a 1.2-mile moderate loop that runs deep into the historic grounds of its early inhabitants. The trail flows into Big Valley where the remnants of the famous Ghost House stand.\nThe story: Locals say that unexplainable events have occurred along Ghost Loop Trail where a cemetery resides holding the remains of the Hutchinson family who used to farm the land. Visitors have shared tales of cries in the woods and mysterious figures in the house.\nWhat else is spooky about Maynardville? Enter if you dare—Jefferson County hosts a well-known attraction called &#8220;Frightmare Manor&#8221; on the land where serial killer Jeremiah Lexer once lived. Tickets start at $27.\nWhiteside Mountain Trail (Whiteside Mountain, North Carolina)\nSpecs: The 2-mile loop at Whiteside Mountain is an iconic landmark along the Eastern Continental Divide that takes you up 750-foot-high cliffs estimated to be 390 to 460 million years old. The trail is rated moderate, but parts of it are quite steep. The 500-foot elevation gain happens seemingly all at once, and is not gradual.\nThe story: The Cherokees believed that Whiteside Mountain was part of a vast rock bridge that a wicked monster, U’tlun’ta, was building across the mountain range. Legend has it that the devil&#8217;s throne exists in a cave there, but more is found around &#8220;U’tlun’ta,&#8221; or &#8220;Spearfinger,&#8221; described as having skin made of stone and one long finger sharpened to cut into the flesh of victims. According to Cherokee legend, Spearfinger was killed by local tribes, but her haunting chant still echoes through the mountains to this day. Locals say the chant goes something like:\nUwe la na tsiku. Su sa sai.\nLiver, I eat it. Su sa sai.\nUwe la na tsiku. Su sa sai\nWhat else is spooky about Whiteside? Those up for it can explore Henry River Mill Village, famous for being a filming location for District 12 in the first Hunger Games movie. Though an abandoned town overall, it offers lodging and guided tours for Hunger Games lovers. Tours are about $20 per person.\nEast Coast Haunted Hikes\nLast but not least, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s spooky about the East. The two chosen trails hold the stories of two lost children, who locals say, still live in the hills.\nBluff Mountain (Monroe, Virginia)\nThis is the exact spot little Ottie Cline Powell’s body was found April 5, 1891, on Bluff Mountain. (Photo: Rockbridge Outdoors)\nSpecs: Bluff Mountain trail, located near the town of Monroe, Virgina, is a hard, 3.7-mile out and back with a nearly 1,400-foot elevation gain. The trail follows a section of the Appalachian Trail from Salt Log Gap to Punch Bowl Crossing. The elevation gain is steady and not dramatic, though there are some steep and rocky spots. You will pass both Punchbowl Mountain and Bluff Mountain that each provide stunning views of the lush Virginian terrain.\nThe story: In 1891, a five-year-old boy named Ottie ventured out with other children to collect firewood to bring back to a schoolhouse near Bluff Mountain, but he failed to show. The boy went missing in March, when snow covered the mountains and the temperatures weren&#8217;t survivable for long. Ottie&#8217;s body was eventually found and buried on the mountainside. His tombstone reads, &#8220;This is the exact spot little Ottie Cline Powell’s body was found April 5, 1891, after straying from Tower Hill School House Nov. 9, a distance of 7 miles. Age 4 years 11 months.”\nLocals say Ottie can be seen wandering through the woods looking for his way back home each year around the time of his disappearance.\nWhat else is spooky about Monroe? Some Virginians say the most haunted place in the state is just outside of Monroe in Radford. St. Albans Sanatorium holds a dark history of patient torture and suffering due to highly experimental treatments, like electroshock therapy. General admission is $20 for a tour.\nRidge Trail via Maiden Cliff Trail (Camden, Maine)\nSpecs: Just over 5 miles out and back, this incredible (but difficult) trail features a nearly 1,500-foot elevation gain and breathtaking view from the top of Mount Megunticook that overlooks the Atlantic Ocean, Penobscot Bay, and the town of Camden.\nThe story: Maiden Cliff in Camden, Maine, is named after Elenora French, a 12-year-old girl who tragically passed away after falling 300 feet from a nearby cliff in 1964 while reaching for her bonnet that had blown off her head. She survived the fall, but later died from her internal injuries. A white cross can be found at the edge of the cliff along the trail, commemorating her life. Maiden Cliff trail leads to her memorial, as well as views of Megunticook Lake.\nHikers say they have seen her spirit wandering around the area, experienced strange cold drafts in the spot she died, and heard her distant cries on windy days.\nWhat else is spooky about Camden? For history buffs and conspiracy theorists—Camden Ghost Walks tour explores the town&#8217;s haunted history that involves The Round Table Foundation, a parapsychology lab documented to have explored telepathy and extrasensory perception (ESP), and other stories of the town&#8217;s castaways and secret government programs. Tickets are $25 per person.",

    "item_subtitle": "We know the Colnago Y1Rs is good enough to win the Tour de France with. Naturally we took it way out of its element.",
    "body_content": "You aren’t supposed to take the Colnago Y1Rs on a 600km gravel adventure. That bike is one of today&#8217;s premier aero race bikes, meant for a highly specific function: speed at all costs. It wouldn&#8217;t be most people&#8217;s first choice for endurance rides, and you certainly wouldn&#8217;t ride it long distances across mixed surfaces.\nI did it anyway.\nWhy? Most of us can&#8217;t own every kind of bike for every kind of ride — but that doesn&#8217;t mean you should let the equipment you do have limit what you can do.\nThis is how I set the bike up to make it work, plus all the gear I used. There’s lessons you can take with you for whatever adventure you want to do with whatever bike you have. First though, let&#8217;s address that claim about what a race bike can and can’t do.\n(Photo Josh Ross/Velo) \nYou can do a lot on an aero race bike\nThe idea that you need a special bike for everything is not only wrong but it also presents a number of problems for regular people who buy bikes. If that narrative is true it really means that you need a stable of different bikes for different purposes. It could also mean you have to have an incredibly, perhaps unrealistic, understanding of your needs when you buy a bike and you can’t change your mind later.\nPersonally, I reject the entire narrative. Certainly some kinds of bikes are better for certain activities but I love the feeling of riding a fast race bike. Aero bike in particular is perfect for long distance riding but whatever bike you have you can do more than you think.\nYou don’t have to buy a perfect bike for every situation and only use it for that situation. A bike like the Colnago Y1RS is incredibly fun to ride and realistically crazy long adventure rides are always going to be a small part of any cyclist&#8217;s riding experience. For lots of people it might even be only once every couple of years. You don’t need a special bike for that but it does require a bit of planning.\nThat&#8217;s an Enve SES 4.5 that the tire is mounted to. (Photo Josh Ross/Velo)\nHow I made the Colnago Y1Rs into an endurance bike\nThe first thing I had to address was a major sticking point in my Colnago Y1Rs review, the outfront mount. The one Colnago provided was terrible for a number of reasons but the number one issue in this case was the lack of an action camera mount on the underside. This is an issue for every Colnago I’ve ever reviewed and this scenario is exactly why I comment on it.\nI didn’t plan to use this bike, and you might not have planned to do that big ride, but I was convinced to do so at the last minute. Colnago doesn’t consider packaging a terrible mount an issue because you can get one from FramesandGear. The problem is that frames and gear is a tiny company and currently out of stock on that mount. You should never have to scramble for a mount at the last minute on a bike that requires a proprietary piece.\nUnfortunately I had to scramble but I found a hacky solution that worked and might apply to your bike also. The Colnago Y1Rs is one of a few bikes, including the Cervelo S5, that uses an adapter to bolt to the bar then connects an arm to that adapter with a GoPro (action camera) mount.\nThe only downside to this is that it&#8217;s a bit short but otherwise this will solve a lot of problems for a variety of bikes. (Photo Josh Ross/Velo) \nTrek also uses that design. Trek expects you to use it with a Trek stem but the Trek stem just has a GoPro adapter that the arm bolts to. You can use it with any GoPro adapter and there are Trek stores everywhere plus tons of inventory and fast shipping if you need it. I was able to walk into a Trek store and purchase a Bontrager Blendr Garmin High Mount.\nAs long as you are using a Garmin, the K-Edge adapter will bolt in without issue. (Photo Josh Ross/Velo) \nThis works but it also opens up a whole new list of problems to solve. First off, it doesn’t have a GoPro adapter which was the original issue. I need that to use with a light on the funky bars. I solved that by adding a K-Edge Combo Mount Adapter I already had on hand. If you don’t, K-Edge is a US company with fast shipping.\nThis the K-Edge adapter mounted on a K-Edge mount but it works on the Bontrager piece as well. (Photo Josh Ross/Velo) \nThere’s still one more issue though. Colnago uses a bolt to secure the two pieces together that will strip if you look at it wrong. Turns out this is because the adapter is plastic and is easy to break if you overtighten. I had an extra adapter on hand but you probably don’t. Go replace the  bolt with something much more robust from the hardware store but tighten it with care once you’ve swapped it out.\nThat’s a lot of description so hopefully it helps someone besides me to cobble together a mounting solution for both a light and computer on whatever bike you need to deal with on a short timeline.\nThe next thing I tackled was tires. This was a mixed surface adventure so I wanted the biggest I could fit and on the Y1Rs, that’s only a 32mm. I also wanted fast and tough. I ended up going with the Pirelli P ZERO Race TLR RS and they were a huge success. I was running the Enve SES 4.5 wheels I discussed in the Colnago review and the 25mm internal width, plus gravel capabilities, kept the sidewalls looking fast and the ride comfortable when paired with the Pirelli tires. I do find these tires wear quite quickly but I got no punctures and they fit.\n(Photo Josh Ross/Velo)\nThat last part was a big part of why I made this choice actually. With the Colnago the real tight spot is between the tire and the downtube. Although a 32 is supposed to fit, it looks pretty tight and I was worried. Pirelli lists the outer diameter in the P Zero specs so I was able to do some measuring ahead of time.\nThat measuring ended up being extra important because I’d wanted to use the Apidura Aero system. I actually think it would have made the Y1Rs faster but it uses a strap on the downtube. It fit with a 28mm tire but I could tell from the Pirelli specs that it wouldn’t work with a 32.\nThe last thing I did was switch from road pedals to gravel. Another complaint of mine in the Colnago Y1Rs review was that there was no power meter included in the builds. That means power pedals and I chose the same Garmin XC200 that I’ve carried across the world and used for many events. They were flawless as always and I look forward to trying the new Garmin XC210 next time.\nThat meant my conversion was pretty sparse. I had a special outfront mount, different pedals, and big tires. You can accomplish this on a whole lot of bikes and most of them will actually accommodate a 34mm tire.\n\n\nview route details on\n\n\nWhat I actually did with the Colnago Y1Rs\nA lot of people will have come here because of the bike I chose so I started there but now let’s talk about what I actually did. The original plan was to ride 500k in one shot. Then the weather changed and it was looking like hard rain through the night. I was definitely not interested in that but I still wanted to do a big ride. I settled on breaking it up to mostly avoid the rain.\nThe weekend centered around the final Swift Summit 200 but I decided to commute there by bike. The event itself is, as the name suggests, 200 miles of mixed surface riding but mostly road. There’s also lots of climbing.\nIt starts in Lebanon Oregon which is about 80 miles from my house if you take the direct route that I did on the way down. Then I stayed in a hotel and did the event. That night I stayed in the hotel again then took a better, but less direct, route home covering about 96 miles.\nThat’s a bit over 600km in three days with the big day in the middle and some of that being on gravel roads. Everything was a success. The only real challenge being the race bike gearing that wasn’t friendly to steep gravel climbs with low traction. As already mentioned though, It did require some planning. Here’s how I handled the rest of the details.\nWhat I carried and how I carried it\nWith no way to carry anything on the bike I ended up using two things to carry what I needed but I also travelled light. The first was the POC Ultra Cycling Vest.\nYou’ve seen me riding in this during a variety of videos including the Colnago Y1Rs review video. I was testing it because I was considering this ride. Having finished all the testing, it’s the best of the hydration packs I’ve used. It’s also the most expensive, doesn’t have great hose routing, and it doesn’t come with a bladder so I grabbed a Hydrapak Contour 2L. I’d still recommend it over anything else.\nThe reason I like it so much is because it’s the best fitting and it actually has a ton of storage. In this case I started with the bladder empty and carrying Tailwind High Carb packages instead of water. I can do 80 miles on my own without a hydration pack so I took advantage of the extra space.\nThe other thing that helped me carry what I needed was the Pedal Ed Odyssey jersey. This is my favorite jersey but it’s also important because it has extra pockets. Specifically on the sides of your torso. Because of this I was able to carry my flat repair, phone, and food plus extra clothes. This is a definite advantage anytime you need to carry a bit more.\nOther than that, I travelled light. No casual clothes or shoes, just a hotel room with a grocery store nearby, a credit card, and walkable two bolt shoes. There’s no need for overpacking. Be concise and you can travel light.\nThose are some of the unique Assos bib tights that pair with these rain pants for winter riding you can see peaking out the bottom. (Photo Josh Ross/Velo) \nThe clothes I wore\nI already discussed the jersey but I used a different set of bib shorts. I also have the Pedal Ed Odyssey bib shorts, and they are great for a normal day ride, but I was worried about chafing on a 14-hour ride. Instead I chose LeCol Arc cargo bib shorts. The fabric is soft and the chamois is excellent. I had no issues with these and I expect they’ll show up in next year’s best bib shorts buyers guide.\nIf this had been any other day of the month the jersey and bibs would have been the clothes. In this case rain was an issue for the exact 24-hours of the event and it was rain clothes I carried in the extra pockets on the Pedal Ed jersey.\nNow in understanding these choices, you have to understand that this was not a little drizzle. If it had been then a softshell solution would have been fine. Instead it was an atmospheric river and while it was only forecast to rain in the night, we started in the night. When you need to travel light and have the best protection you need hardshell clothing and I recommend rain paints.\nA lot of people will say never to rain pants. Aren’t they for commuters?\nThere are certainly commuter focused rain paints but there are also a variety of options for riding fast. One of them is the ¾ length Assos Mille GT Thermo rain pants that can pair with Assos bib tights for the absolute best winter solution. On their own though these are great in warmer, but heavy, rain and that’s how I used them. The other advantage is they are easy to take off when it stops raining and they pack down very small.\nIf you want warm, protective, and packable, go with hardshell options. (Photo Josh Ross/Velo)\nFor a jacket I, again, chose a hardshell. This time I thought I was testing a Rapha Proteam Rain Jacket but it’s been discontinued. Functionally it’s the same as the Gorewear Spinshift Gore-Tex jacket as both have a similar cut and use the same Gore-Tex ePe membrane. If you want to stay warm and dry but also pack light, this is my suggestion.\nI also carried two pairs of gloves. I’ve taken to using long finger gloves even in the summer and my favorite of these is the Q36.5 long finger adventure gloves. They feel great and there’s just enough padding.\nThe Q36.5 are also summer gloves and I needed something warmer just in case. What I brought were a set of Sportful Lobster Glove shell gloves. These have become a go to of mine because they pack down to nothing and you can add a lot of warmth and water resistance if needed. Unfortunately they have also just been discontinued. As I write this another option would be the Assos RSR Thermo Rain Shell Glove but those are disappearing fast as well. Hopefully I’ll have something else to share before winter hits harder. \nFor shoes, I chose the Specialized S-Works Recon that’s down in the Other Cycling Shoes section of our Best Cycling Shoes guide. I made that choice because I know that Specialized shoes work well for my feet, I needed walkable but stiff shoes, and I wanted to put them to a big test. They passed with flying colors as I mostly didn’t think about them.\n(Photo Josh Ross/Velo)\nThe helmet I brought was the Specialized S-Works Evade 3 but this one was a more considered choice. That helmet is one of many in our Best Bike Helmet guide but it’s the one I choose almost every time. A fast aero helmet is worth as many watts as deep wheels and over long distances a little adds up to a lot.\nThese still wear out, and this one is definitely worn out, but it takes a while. (Photo Josh Ross/Velo)\nThe only challenge with the Evade 3 is that it can cause sweat to drip into my eyes. I solved that with something called a Veo Strip. It’s supposed to be a one-time use on your forehead but I put it on the front pad on the inside of my helmet instead. No more sweat in my eyes but also nothing that’s one-time use and stuck to my forehead.\nThe Veo strips also help keep your glasses clean. In this case I went with Shimano glasses because I knew I’d be moving in and out of different lighting. The Shimano Pulsar glasses have a photochromic option that goes fully clear and lets you take off the lower rim for… well just for style.\nI drop this whole setup into my jersey pocket on extra long rides then don&#8217;t have to worry about battery life in the least bit. (Photo Josh Ross/Velo)\nLights, computers, batteries and phones\nAs I mentioned above, one of the things I had to do with the Colnago Y1Rs was figure out an outfront mounting solution. The solution I landed on worked perfectly but it didn’t have enough length to handle a Garmin 1040 Solar. Instead I chose the Garmin 840 Solar that, at the time, was the number one choice in our best bike computers buyer’s guide.\nThe Garmin 840 Solar is a fantastic balance of features and battery life and this kind of scenario is why I placed it in the top spot in that guide. It’s small and light with access to training insights through Garmin Connect but it also has high quality navigation features in case you need to quickly reroute without pulling out a phone. Just to give you an idea of battery life, I finished the 200 mile day and forgot to charge it. I still had enough battery to cover the last 100 miles home.\nUnder the Garmin computer is where I mounted the Exposure Strada Mk 12 AKTiv that I used for a light. Now this particular adventure did not actually involve riding through the night but that was what I planned for and the Exposure light was a big part of that. It was also the basis for a rethink as a new model has just landed.\nMany of the best lights use an action camera mount making it easy to manage with weird bars as long as there&#8217;s also a good outfront mount. (Photo Josh Ross/Velo) \nThe bottom line here is that in full darkness (no streetlights) and heavy rain the 10-hour program mode for the Strada Mk12 was enough. What that means is not an easy answer, you have to do a bunch of math to figure it out and it still remains elusive. Still, expect that to be around 500 lumens and you can now get that with the recently launched Exposure Lights Toro 16 for 12-hours. If you need to ride through the night, choose this light and it will definitely be in our best bike lights buyers guide.\nWhich brings a conclusion to on-the-bike electronics but this is 2025 and there’s more. I did this ride with the recently launched Google Pixel 10 Pro XL. I made that choice because it’s got a great camera and long battery life but I still wasn’t sure how long. It’s tough to calculate what it takes to share my location constantly, plus move in and out of service, and play music. That means I also rely on its ability to stick to the Anker MagGo Power Bank and wirelessly charge in my jersey pocket. Simple stuff but I listen to music from Shokz OpenRun Pro 2, share my location with my wife, and I don’t want a dead phone in an emergency.\nPick whatever phone you want but if you like to do big rides, consider battery life and charging.\nIf you are curious how I got the video while riding, that&#8217;s from the Insta360 X5.\nEnjoy the race bike, it won’t hold you back\nI obviously did something that’s a bit silly. A Colnago Y1Rs is not an ideal all-road bike. That’s the point though. If I can manage a 600k mixed surface adventure on that bike, you can do it on your favorite everyday bike.\nI encourage you to optimize for the bike you want to ride most of the time and not worry about the edge cases. Make some smart equipment choices, which hopefully I’ve helped with, and you can manage most adventures on most bikes.",

    "item_subtitle": "American Jim Morrison summited Everest and spread the ashes of his late partner, Hilaree Nelson, before skiing down.",
    "body_content": "On October 15, American ski mountaineer Jim Morrison stood atop Mount Everest. The 50-year-old wasn&#8217;t just on the highest point on Earth to enjoy the view; he was there to say a final goodbye, and to make history. Morrison carried the ashes of his late partner, Hilaree Nelson, the famed ski mountaineer who died on Mount Manaslu in 2022.\nMorrison spread Nelson’s ashes on Everest’s summit. Then, he fastened a pair of skis and dropped into a harrowing ski descent of the Hornbein Couloir, an infamously steep, narrow chute. When connected to the Japanese Couloir below, it forms a line that plummets nearly 12,000 vertical feet. Morrison previously called the route &#8220;the greatest line never skied,&#8221; and now, his effort is perhaps the most impressive ski descent of all time.\n“I had a little conversation with [Nelson] and felt like I could dedicate the whole day to her,” Morrison told National Geographic. Nelson, one of the world’s leading ski mountaineers, had been killed by an avalanche while the duo were attempting to descend Manaslu.\nLocated on Mount Everest&#8217;s North Face, the Hornbein has captivated mountaineers since Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld made its first ascent in 1963. Morrison’s party was only the sixth to ascend the route, and the first since 1991.\n\nSkiing from Everest is far from a new endeavor: Japan’s Yūichirō Miura succeeded in descending much of the peak on skis back in 1970. A documentary about the feat, The Man Who Skied Down Everest, became the first athletic film to win an Academy Award. Last month, Polish ski mountaineer Andrzej Bargiel skied from the summit down to Everest Base Camp, via the standard Southeast Ridge Route, without supplemental oxygen.\nBut a ski descent of the Hornbein is another beast entirely. No route is as dizzyingly steep, and the world’s best have eyed it for decades. As Outside reported in 2024, the Hornbein is “a 1,500-vertical-foot gully whose maw opens just 1,000 feet below the peak’s summit, and then spills mercilessly onto the 5,500-foot slope beneath. The narrow gully teeters between 45 and 60 degrees in steepness, bends gently in the middle, and then narrows to about the width of a standing human body.”\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nA post shared by The North Face (@thenorthface)\n\n\n\nIf you want to get off the top of Mount Everest as quickly as possible—save for strapping on a wingsuit and leaping off—the Hornbein is the way.\n“The conditions were abominable,” Morrison told National Geographic. “It was a mix of survival skiing and actual shredding. Some sections were smooth enough for real turns. Others were rutted and raised four feet up and down, like frozen waves.”\nAs he made his way through the technical sections of the couloir high on the mountain, including a 650-foot stretch of bare rock that required a rappel, conditions began to improve and the skiing got easier. But that just left Morrison feeling bittersweet.\n“I kept thinking, I’m never coming back here,” Morrison said. “I should get a few more turns in while I can.”\nFor Morrison, the descent seemed to be an exercise in letting go, both of his late partner’s ashes and the shared dream they had of skiing the Hornbein together one day.\n“When I finally crossed the bergschrund, I cried,” he added. “I’d risked so much, but I was alive. It felt like a tribute to Hilaree—something she’d be proud of. I really felt her with me, cheering me on.”",

    "item_subtitle": "You're about to find your new favorite yoga video.",
    "body_content": "I recently invited my mom to take a beginner’s yoga class with me.\n“But you’ve been doing yoga for a while,” she said. “Why would you want to go to a beginner’s class?”\nI searched my mind for where to begin. I considered starting off with, “Yoga is about the journey, not the destination,” but I didn’t want to scare her off with a yoga platitude. I could’ve said that I often learn more from beginner’s classes than anywhere else. Yoga for beginners is also my way of easing back into physical movement after an injury or when I&#8217;m being less active.\n“Actually, I really enjoy beginner yoga classes,” I said. And it’s true. One of the best things about yoga is that, whether you’re yoga curious or you’ve been teaching for 20 years, a beginner’s class can help slow you down and strengthen your practice by returning to the foundations. For me, it&#8217;s a reminder of why we do this thing called yoga in the first place.\nIn the end, my mom and I didn’t attend the in-person class. But I did share with her my favorite list of YouTube yoga practices, specifically made for beginners. I was reminded that sometimes it’s best to remove as many obstacles as possible in order to get started with or return to yoga. You have it all within you—and, technically, on YouTube—already. Gotta love that beginner’s mindset.\n6 Best Beginner Yoga Practices on YouTube\nWhether you’re new to yoga or looking for a practice that brings you back to the basics, you’ll find exactly what you’re seeking in these YouTube yoga videos.\n\n1. 10 Minute Yoga for Beginners\nYoga With Kassandra walks you through a slow and intentional sequence in this yoga for beginners practice. She uses simple alignment cues that make all the difference in complex poses including Low Lunge and Down Dog. With plenty of low-to-the-floor poses and no background music, this YouTube yoga video gives a chill vibe. One commenter captures their favorite moment by saying, “Once your cat walked in, I knew I was in the right place.”\nPractice a gentle stretch.\n\n2. 15 Minute Gentle Yoga Flow\nSimple neck and shoulder stretches ease you into an active yet grounding flow in this Charlie Follows YouTube yoga practice. Although it’s yoga for beginners, there are challenging movements (stepping back to Plank) along with cues for less intense pose variations (knees down in Chaturanga). The ambient music, calming voiceover, and natural light-filled space in the video all support the “gentle” vibe of the practice.\nRelease tension now.\n\n3. Easy Yoga Stretch for Tension Relief\nThis practice feels like an escape for the body and mind by way of floating on a yoga cloud for 10 minutes. In no more than 10 poses, Yoga with Bird guides you through mostly reclined, full-body stretches. Instead of taking a typical Cat&#8211;Cow, she encourages you to listen to what your body needs and move your hips side to side or in a circle. The moment serves as a reminder that the practice is for *you.*\nPractice an easy stretch.\n\n4. Feel-Good Flow and Stretch\nIf you’re looking to challenge your body yet still feel fully in control, this 25-minute practice by Akshaya Agnes can help with that. The beginner’s flow starts with simple warm-ups. Even when it moves on to more complex poses (Warrior 2, Triangle), Agnes’s uncomplicated cues help align your body in an easy-to-understand way. Stay tuned toward the end for iconic and energizing postures including Goddess Pose and Tree Pose.\nMove through a beginner’s flow.\n\n5. 30-Minute Yoga for Beginners\nThere are a lot of things a teacher could say when teaching yoga for beginners; but sometimes what matters most is what they don’t say. Nico Marie strikes the perfect balance between setting up newbies and returning students for success, gently nudging what to focus on, without overwhelming. Her tips echo yoga fundamentals: focus on the breath and rest when you need. The practice takes you through an active yet slow-moving sequence set to calming background music. And there are plenty of moments of silence that allow you to sink further into your experience.\nFlow for 30 minutes.\n\n6. Yoga Flow for Beginners\nIf you’re like me and you sometimes feel as if yoga flows move waaaay too fast, you might appreciate this 25-minute practice by Yoga With Adriene. Appropriately named “Intro to Flow,” it’s sorta an entry level course to vinyasa flow, which links poses together, with plenty of time to get your bearings in the transitions in between. Adriene demonstrates how to use props for support in poses including Revolved Lunge. I recommend keeping your blocks close by during the entire practice as you never know when they might be welcome, whether for your hands in Forward Bend or even if you want to make Bridge Pose restful by placing a block underneath your sacrum.\nTake an intro to flow.",

    "body_content": "Another seemingly impossible notch was just etched into Everest’s history when ski mountaineer Jim Morrison made the first successful ski descent of the 29,032-foot peak’s Hornbein Couloir. Morrison, documented by a team from National Geographic and The North Face, including climber and filmmaker Jimmy Chin, skied from the summit on a North Face route that included the Hornbein—previously considered near-impossible to descend on skis—down to Camp 1, an amazing 12,000 vertical feet.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nA post shared by The North Face (@thenorthface)\n\n\n\nBefore the trip down, the group had to first summit the peak—a missive feat in itself. On the morning of Oct. 15, the crew set out from Camp 4, reaching the summit at around 12:45 p.m. local time, where he scattered the ashes of his late partner, Hilaree Nelson. Nelson died three years ago when she was swept off the slopes of Manaslu while climbing with Morrison. The gesture was a large part of why Morrison was determined to capture the summit and the ensuing descent.\nWithout much time to waste, Morrison then clicked into his skis at 2 p.m. local time and pushed off down the North Face via the Hornbein Couloir, known as a treacherously steep, narrow, and technical chute prone to slides. Although its north-facing aspect holds snow well, the logistics of navigating such a tight space on skis has kept other adventurers at bay. One of the most famous attempts of Hornbein, snowboarder Marco Siffredi’s 2002 run, ended with the 23-year-old Frenchman disappearing off the mountain. His body still hasn’t been located.\nWorld-renowned ski mountaineer Jim Morrison, left, and Jimmy Chin. (Photo: National Geographic/Savannah Cummins)\nIt took Morrison just over four hours to navigate the complicated descent, needing to execute countless hop turns in impossibly tight spots, boot-pack his way through wind-swept snow and ice-covered rocks, and even rappel 650 feet down impassable terrain. According to Explorer’s Web, Morrison lowered himself carefully past discarded oxygen canisters and the unrecoverable bodies of couloir namesake Tim Hornbein and climbing partner Willi Unsoeld from the pair’s 1963 expedition.\nThe ski mountaineer skied into Camp 1 just before 8 p.m. local time, telling National Geographic that he felt Nelson spirit with him along parts of the descent.\nAlready being called “the most audacious ski run in history,” Morrison’s success can be attributed to his unique mastery of ski alpinism, mountaineering, and sheer athleticism. His personal mission to scatter Nelson&#8217;s ashes can’t be discounted as motivation behind his incredible success.\nThe whole expedition, from the planning stages to the aftermath, has been documented and will be shared in a film from Nat Geo and Jimmy Chin. The “Everest North” (which is the working title) release date has yet to be shared, but we can say with certainty that we’ll be first in line.",

    "body_content": "Consider the humble ramen packet. At about 400 calories per 3-ounce block, it&#8217;s a light and energy efficient staple for backpackers conscious of how much weight they&#8217;re toting. It&#8217;s versatile—you can use ramen for anything from soup to noodles carbonara. But most importantly, it&#8217;s easy: All you need to cook a serving is a few minutes and some hot water.\nBut while it&#8217;s convenient, ramen has some downsides. Its high caloric load is useful after a taxing day on the trail, but instant ramen is usually fried in palm oil, and packs a wallop of saturated fat and sodium. With some evidence suggesting that even the exertion of a long hike isn&#8217;t enough to offset the health effects of a diet heavy in processed foods, it&#8217;s worth it to have a few alternatives in your bag of tricks.\nTrading your instant noodles for spaghetti is a smart swap that gives you more control over both the content and taste of what you&#8217;re eating—no more overcooked mush or lip-wrinkling seasoning packets. But while cooking regular spaghetti on the trail is possible, especially if you pre-soak it, it takes a lot more fuel and time than simply pouring water over your dinner.\nA smarter idea: Pre-cook and dehydrate your pasta instead. Prepping ahead of time (I like to use thin spaghetti, but any shape will do) takes just a few hours, and the resulting noodles rehydrate in just 8 to 10 minutes.\nRegular spaghetti noodles can take a long time to cook on a camp stove. Dehydrated spaghetti, on the other hand, just takes a few minutes. (Photo: AscentXmedia/Getty Images)\nRecipe: Dehydrated Spaghetti\nIngredients:\n\nHalf a package of thin spaghetti (approximately 8 ounces)\n\nDirections:\n\nCook the spaghetti until al dente, following the directions on the package.\nDrain the pasta, then pour onto a paper towel-lined baking sheet and pat dry to remove excess moisture.\nSpread the spaghetti in a single layer on the trays of a dehydrator, and dry for 2 to 6 hours at 135°F, periodically checking for doneness. Alternatively, dry in the oven at its lowest setting.\nWhen spaghetti is dry and brittle, remove from dehydrator, allow to cool, and package in a reusable zip-top bag. Use in soups or pasta dishes of your choice.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;",

    "item_title": "Worried About Stress Fractures? Look at Your Run Cadence.",
    "item_subtitle": "Here’s why coaches are always encouraging runners to pick up the tempo.",
    "body_content": "Over the many years he’s been a competitive runner, Jason Richwall, a DO candidate and third-year medical student at Rowan-Virtua School of Medicine in Stratford, New Jersey, had listened to his coaches drone on about picking up his run cadence. It seemed every coach had a thing for fast feet, but they didn’t always have a good, scientific explanation for why they were giving that advice.\nEventually, Richwall, who ran cross-country and track at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and ran for a season at Rowan University while working on his Master’s degree, wanted to know why exactly cadence was such a big deal. So when it came time to complete a research project as part of his medical degree, Richwall dug into the literature and found plenty of evidence to suggest that his coaches had actually been right all along &#8211; even if they didn’t know why.\n“Across the board, virtually all of the studies I looked at suggested that quicker running cadence or shorter stride length are correlated with lower risk of occurrence of injuries,” he says. Specifically stress fractures, which are called bone stress injuries these days, declined when cadence increased.\nBut why does a faster cadence reduce injury risk? “A lot of it has to do with force,” says Milica McDowell, DPT, certified exercise physiologist, and vice president of operations at Gait Happens, a group of clinicians focused on foot health education and resources to support efficient movement.\nThe force is (pushing) against you\nIt might seem a little counterintuitive at first, but fast, light feet really can reduce the impact on the lower body during running. That’s because every time your foot strikes the ground, not only is your body pushing down against the surface, the surface is also pushing back on your body. This is called ground reaction force and is exactly what Sir Isaac Newton was talking about when he jotted down his third rule of motion &#8211; the Law of Action and Reaction.\nThis law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. So, whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first.\nThis is important because while increasing cadence means your foot is striking the ground more frequently in a minute, “you’re actually spending less time in contact with the ground,” McDowell explains. Though each strike might be just a millisecond shorter, over the course of thousands of steps during a long run, that time adds up significantly.\nThis in turn decreases the amount of load your body experiences as you run and the amount of ground reaction force your body must absorb in return.\nThat force depends in part on your mass, or how much you weigh. A lighter runner exerts less force on the ground and gets less force in return than a heavier runner. Acceleration also comes into play – sprinting creates more force than lightly jogging. Bone strength is also a factor; bone stress injuries occur when the strength of the bone can’t match the amount of stress being placed on it.\n(Photo: Canva)\nMcDowell gives the example of banging on a drum hard versus banging on it lightly. “If you were trying to make a really loud noise, you’d strike it really hard. But if you’re trying to make a softer noise, you might strike it more softly so you don’t get as much impact.” And if you hit it with all your might or use an object that concentrates that force into a smaller point, you could break the drum, which in this example represents your bones.\nWith a faster cadence, you’re also minimizing some of the biomechanical angles, which changes how quickly the load of your body mass goes through your bones. This was demonstrated in a 2018 study in the Journal of Biomechanics, the gold-standard publication for kinematics.\nAdjusting your stride length can also reduce risk of injury in some cases, though McDowell emphasizes that there’s a difference between cadence and stride length. “Cadence is the number of strikes per minute,” while stride length describes the distance you cover with each step.\n“Now, it’s pretty common to say the faster you turn your legs over, the more it shortens your stride,” she notes, but the two don’t always go hand-in-hand.\nThat said, shortening your stride can prevent overstriding, “which is where people are running like they’re jumping over a puddle and really extending those legs out &#8211; this is not efficient,” McDowell explains, and adds that it can lead to a range of injuries from shin splints and stress fractures to runner’s knee.\nHow to increase run cadence\nThe first step toward improving your cadence is figuring out what your natural baseline cadence is, McDowell says. “In order to do that, you need to be your own research guinea pig.”\nSet a timer on your watch for 60 seconds and count every right leg strike while you run comfortably. Once you’ve got a number, multiply that by two and it will tell you how many steps you’ve taken in a minute. (Some smartwatches can calculate this for you, though accuracy may be a concern.)\nRepeat this exercise a few times over a couple of workouts to check that you’re getting consistent readings.\nOnce you’ve got that number, then it’s time to start nudging it up. McDowell recommends downloading a metronome app and setting it for your desired cadence. Match your foot falls to the beat of the metronome.\nThe key is to adjust slowly over time. “You can’t just cold turkey go from running at 160 and try to run at 185,” she says. So, if your baseline cadence is 160, which McDowell says “is a little slower than optimal,” you can work on increasing it for a minute or two at a time before dropping back down to your baseline. It’ll take some time, but keep at it; eventually, the higher cadence will start to feel normal.\nWhile many people’s natural cadence falls somewhere in the neighborhood of 170, aiming for a cadence above 180 has been shown to be effective for reducing injury risk in long-distance running. But it’s not a magic number: Cadence is an individual thing and you should play with it to find what’s optimal for your body.\nIn addition, “if you’re a sprinter, this does not apply because sprinting and running are completely different, just like running and walking are completely different,” McDowell says. But if you’re aiming for a 5K or a marathon, “you want to think about being efficient,” she says.\nIt’s also important to keep in mind that increasing cadence does not automatically mean your running speed will increase, but you may be able to reach the finish line with a little less wear-and-tear on your body &#8211; and you may be able to train with greater consistency, over longer distances to build better race-day gains.",

    "item_subtitle": "A recent study peers deep into the family tree to find a Neanderthal mutation - present in 20% of modern humans - might be detrimental to endurance athletic performance.",
    "body_content": "In the 1992 film “Encino Man,” a long-dormant Neanderthal (played by Brendan Fraser) resurfaces after an earthquake and thaws out in late-20th-century southern California. With the assistance of two teenagers (played by Pauly Shore and Sean Astin), the caveman, now named Link, enrolls in high school and hilarity ensues.\nUniversally panned by critics, “Encino Man” nevertheless boomed at the box office, in part because of how the film played with the vastly different yet oh-so-similar comparison of Link to his modern-day counterparts.\nWhat wasn’t known at the time the film was made is that all three lead characters quite possibly carry some Neanderthal DNA in their own cells. You possibly do, too &#8211; and new science shows it may impact your performance as an endurance athlete.\nYour Neanderthal DNA\nNeanderthals, while eerily human-like in many ways, are very definitely not homo sapiens. But the two species coexisted on planet Earth for several thousand years. This was roughly 40,000 to 50,000 years ago, long before Tinder and Hinge; nevertheless, members of the two populations sometimes got freaky together. Today, buried deep in modern human DNA lies undeniable, enduring evidence that Neanderthals and homo sapiens interbred.\nIt’s believed that 20% of the Neanderthal genome lives on in the modern human gene pool, and for some humans, that means up to about 2% of their genes come from Neanderthals.\nSeveral direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies look for these markers in the cheek swabs and spit samples they analyze. This means that when you get your report back, you might find that you’ve got French, German, Polish, and Neanderthal ancestry, for example.\nFor most people, this is just a point of interest that has little bearing on their day-to-day existence, besides suggesting why their hair has a certain texture or they have other physical traits. Currently, there’s limited research that shows having Neanderthal ancestry changes an individual’s disease risk profile, but so far, there’s been little actionable information that can be gleaned from analyzing such genetic variations.\nBut research into Neanderthal genes and their influence on human carriers continues. One particularly interesting study published July 2025 in the journal Nature Communications suggested that a specific Neanderthal gene variant holds what sounds like dire implications for carriers who are aiming to engage in endurance or power sports activities.\nThe missing endurance enzyme\n20% of the Neanderthal genome lives on in the modern human gene pool, and new research finds those who carry a specific variant were half as likely to become top athletes in endurance and power sports as those without the variant. (Photo: Jan Hetfleisch/Ironman)\nIn conjunction with researchers at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology and Sweden’s Karolinska Institute, the study was conducted at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, one of the foremost institutions investigating the connection between Neanderthals and humans. It was there in 2006 that Nobel Prize-winning scientist Svante Pääbo initiated the “Neandertal Genome Project,” which led to sequencing the entire Neanderthal genome in 2008. Ever since, the lab has continued peering into the genetic code of archaic peoples.\nThis study, led by Dominik Macak, a PhD candidate at the Max Planck Institute, looked at 2,700 individuals and found that those who carried a specific Neanderthal gene variant were half as likely to become top athletes in endurance and power sports as those without the variant.\nThat’s because the variant can alter the body’s ability to generate energy during intense exercise. During exercise, cells break down a molecule called adenosine triphosphate. ATP is often referred to as the “body’s batteries,” and it’s created by turning two molecules of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into one molecule of ATP and one molecule of adenosine monophosphate (AMP).\nThe ATP is used to power skeletal muscle movement and is especially important in endurance and strength-based activities. The AMP molecule, on the other hand, is a byproduct that’s discarded through the action of an enzyme called AMPD1.\nAMPD1 is a key enzyme, and mutations that impair its function are the most common cause of metabolic myopathy, a group of genetic disorders that interfere with muscle cell energy production. Metabolic myopathies affect 9% to 14% of people of European ancestry and can cause heart problems, make receiving anesthesia dangerous, and cause exercise intolerance.\nSymptom severity can range from no symptoms at all to very severe muscle symptoms where the individual cannot exercise at all, depending on many other environmental and genetic factors.\nProduction of this enzyme is impaired in those with the Neanderthal gene variant.\nTo discover this, the researchers recreated the Neanderthal version of the AMPD1 enzyme and tested it in the lab. Under those conditions, they found Neanderthal AMPD1 was 25% less active than the same enzyme produced in humans with other variants of the gene.\nThen, the researchers genetically engineered mice to express the Neanderthal version of AMPD1 and found that the impact was even greater than in the lab; the Neanderthal version of the enzyme was 80% less active than the non-Neanderthal variant.\nThe issue is that the enzyme impairment allows AMP to build up in the person’s muscles, making it more difficult for them to produce ATP as fast as it’s needed by the cells. This isn’t usually a problem, as most processes are powered by other energy sources. But for people engaging in endurance sports or exercises that demand muscle power, this impairment likely limits their capacity to do that work.\nThe researchers assessed the prevalence of the gene among elite athletes and non-athletes and found that 4% to 14% of athletes carried this genetic variant, while 9% to 19% of non-athletes had the variant. Individuals can inherit one or two copies of the gene variant, depending on whether one or both parents are carriers. People who carried just one copy of the Neandertal gene had a 50% lower likelihood of achieving elite athletic status.\nSounds grim, doesn’t it? But take heart – even if you have this genetic mutation, it’s unlikely to cause you any real issues. “What this study shows is there are certain genetic variants that exist within us that, on a regular day-to-day basis, show no effect. But when you put them in a certain context – like this protein in the context of sport where you want to achieve high muscular power – then the effect becomes clear,” Macak explains.\nSo, this common mutation is unlikely to cause any health issues or major limitations for most people, even the most ardent triathlete.\nMaximizing your genetic makeup\nSo what does this all mean for you as an endurance athlete?\nThere’s really no need to test for a variation, unless you are having symptoms that might indicate the presence of a metabolic myopathy. While the mutation evidently reduces the likelihood of becoming an elite athlete by half, there are many other factors that influence athletic performance, including some 200 genes, Macak says.\nNot all of those other genes have been well-studied yet, and there are other aspects that also come into play: nutrition, psychology, and the environment in which you’re competing, for starters.\nWhy this variation arose in the first place is also still under scrutiny. “It’s very fascinating that these mutations arose because there doesn’t seem to be an obvious advantage to them,” Macak says. “But we’re working to figure that out.”\nMacak adds that it’s very unlikely that this single mutation caused the Neanderthals to die out because it existed for so long and is present in all of the Neanderthal samples they’ve tested, which span the globe and eons. “If this mutation would cause you to not be able to hunt your food, then it wouldn’t have lasted for tens of thousands of years,” he reasons.\nAll Neanderthals appear to have had this genetic variant; today, it’s found in up to 8% of Europeans, 3% of Native Americans, and 2% of South Asians. It’s apparently absent in Africans, East Asians, and African-Americans.\nIf, for some reason, you know you have this genetic variation, there’s not much you can do about it. But Macak recommends adopting a personalized training plan and addressing any muscle-related symptoms you might experience, such as cramps or fatigue.\nNutritionally, there’s not much guidance available either, except to ensure good nutritional practices (more on that here). “The condition of being deficient of this enzyme has been known since the ’70s, and there are currently no nutritional recommendations for this disease,” he notes.\nNevertheless, don’t let a pesky genetic variant keep you from trying a triathlon or any other endurance or power sport you want to pursue. “I would never discourage someone who knows they have this mutation to not give it a go,” he says.\nAlthough having this variant suggests you’re less likely to end up as an elite athlete, that’s not an absolute certainty. And it also doesn’t mean you can’t still have a great time competing at the level you can achieve.\nAfter all, if Encino Man can wake up 40,000 years after being entombed in an ice cave, then anything is possible.",

    "body_content": "Cycling’s version of European football’s relegation-promotion system comes to a head this week in the WorldTour.\nThe bottom dwellers of the WorldTour and the most ambitious teams in the second tier are in a desperate end-of-season scramble for points that could see them climb into or fall out of cycling’s Premier League.\nFor the handful of teams involved in the all-or-nothing three-year tug-of-war for points to assure a spot in the next round of 18 WorldTour licenses, there’s going to be a huge party or an existential risk to the future of a team’s operation, depending on which end they come out on.\nEveryone else is already on the beach.\nIt’s cycling’s ultimate high-stakes game of musical chairs: Get a spot at the WorldTour table, or risk losing sponsors and seeing top stars ask out of contracts.\nYet the controversial introduction of the soccer-inspired league system — imposed by UCI president David Lappartient going into 2020 — doesn’t solve cycling’s biggest problems, and it only creates new ones.\nThe only assurance that top pro teams truly want — and the only reason they feign any interest in WorldTour team standings at all — is to punch their sure-bet ticket to the Tour de France.\nThe Tour de France and Tour de France Femmes are the only races that transcend the sport and truly capture the imagination of the mainstream sports fan.\nNo one knows who won the WorldTour. Everyone knows who won the yellow jersey.\nHaving the guarantee that it will be at the Tour start line is the only inherent value of a WorldTour license. The relegation-promotion format sort of solves that problem.\nAt a deeper level, however, the three-year rotation of WorldTour licenses is the latest &#8220;patch&#8221; for the even bigger problems that have roiled elite men’s cycling for decades.\nThe eternal power struggle between the organization that holds all of cycling’s marbles — Tour de France owners ASO — and the top teams who say they want and deserve a slice of the financial pie has been raging since the 1990s.\nThe UCI’s WorldTour relegation-promotion is the latest effort to bridge the widening gulf between cycling’s two sometimes antagonistic power centers.\nYet WorldTour guarantee does nothing to quell the underlying frustration that permeates much of professional road racing, or address the gnawing question that pro racing could be something much bigger.\nInstead, we&#8217;re left with this beautiful mess called relegation-promotion.\nWhat does relegation-promotion aim to do?\nThe wins haven&#8217;t come for Cofidis, and the team is facing relegation.  (Photo: Tim de Waele/Getty Images)\nAt the micro level — though it can seem as clear as mud — the UCI’s relegation-promotion scheme does a pretty good job at imposing some sort of accountability for struggling teams and provides a clearer pathway for rising squads with big ambitions.\nIt scraps the former sometimes-controversial review panel and makes performance and merit the deciding factors for WorldTour qualification.\nWatered down, it comes down to this: Win enough points during a three-year period and you’re in. Struggle, and you’re out.\nIt’s confusing and sometimes unfair, but relegation adds another layer of who&#8217;s in, who&#8217;s out to the season-long narrative that was never there in cycling.\nThe latest battle playing out in the waning days of 2025 sees four teams fighting to secure one of the final top-18 spots on the three-year running points tally.\nThere are a few interesting wrinkles this year, including how a rumored merger between Intermarché-Wanty and Lotto could open up an “extra” spot in the WorldTour.\nYou need to be a forensic auditor to unravel this rabbit hole of points, but if Uno-X can finish the three-year tally where it’s currently ranked in 19th, the all-Scandinavian team might be in if the merger goes through.\nRight now, Uno-X looks like it will fall just short of WorldTour promotion, a deficit of about 600 points that might come down to a few more wins or a strong stage-race result.\nFrench squads Team Cofidis and Arkéa B&amp;B — the latter of which could shutter this season after it lost the backing from its primary sponsors — look to be the two relegated teams, currently ranked 20th and 21st, respectively.\nFor the teams on the bubble — and the 60 to 80 racers, soigneurs, sport directors, bus drivers, mechanics, and the mini-army of staffers that are part of every team — the next week has huge implications.\nRiders could be caught out without a contract. Some could lose jobs. Cofidis&#8217; boss Cedric Vasseur has already been sacked.\nBeyond that, the WorldTour designation on its own has no real value.\nThere’s no million-euro payout. It’s not like winning the Champions League or the Formula 1 constructors&#8217; championship team prize.\nThere might be some interest among the very top super teams, if only for bragging rights to show to their well-heeled team backers that they’re the world’s No. 1 squad.\nFor the middle-of-the-pack teams, especially after the scare that some legacy teams endured when they were caught off guard in the first three-year cycle, staying where they are is just fine.\nRacing like every point counts\nUno-X has been on the rise all season.  (Photo: Chris Auld/Velo)\nThere are some upsides to the madness of relegation-promotion. Now every team has to race like its existence depends on every point, because it does.\nBut does it make any sense in cycling?\nWhen the first relegation-promotion system came out, I thought it was a crazy idea, but after watching some wacky stuff play out over the past few years, there are some merits to the concept.\nTeams always race to perform, but with the threat of relegation hanging over their heads, it changes the calculus.\nEven if every sports manager will tell you they&#8217;re racing to win, you know every one of them will have one eye on the UCI points.\nBut are teams racing for placings to earn points? Yes.\nYet if the &#8220;Big 4&#8221; and the super teams are hogging up the podiums anyway, a top spot is as good as it’s going to get for most riders and teams anyway.\nAre teams taking riders to chase points in random races they otherwise wouldn’t even start? Yes. Uno-X is sending riders to the Chrono des Nations this week in a last-ditch effort to hit the top 18.\nThe big flaw of the relegation-promotion system — much like the soccer leagues that it emulates — is that it punishes the smaller and poorer teams.\nBig-budget outfits like UAE and Visma — cycling&#8217;s equivalent to Real Madrid and Manchester City — don’t even think about WorldTour rankings because they can afford to pay millions to the best riders.\nIt’s at the bottom where things get messy.\nNo prize for promotion\nA winless season from Girmay hasn&#8217;t helped the fortunes of Intermarché-Wanty. (Photo: MARCO BERTORELLO/AFP via Getty Images)\nIn today&#8217;s relegation-promotion peloton, a team’s future could depend on one late-season illness or a bad injury to a star rider.\nIntermarché-Wanty, clinging to the last safe spot in 18th, is lagging in the team rankings in part because its star sprinter Biniam Girmay is having an off-year.\nUnlike European football, with its mid-season transfer window open to teams to trade players or replace injured ones, cycling’s transfer season closes before the racing calendar starts, meaning teams are stuck with their rosters all year long and can do little to replace injured or under-performing riders.\nIn European football, relegation and promotion are very much a big deal. A team’s feature can often depend just on one goal across an entire season.\nYet promotion into the top league in soccer also reaps millions of dollars in shared TV rights for the teams making the leap.\nIn cycling, teams get nothing when they’re promoted to the WorldTour, and in fact, must pay to be there in the form of annual fees paid to the UCI.\nPerhaps there is some poetic justice for the teams that are fully relegated out of the WorldTour.\nBecause, to be honest, you have to be pretty bad to not be able to stay there.\nCycling&#8217;s biggest challenges remain unanswered\nASO still yields much of the power in pro racing. (Photo: JULIEN DE ROSA/AFP via Getty Images)\nAt the macro level, this latest soccer-inspired solution does nothing to address the major ongoing debate within cycling: who owns the sport and who should see the benefits.\nFor decades now, teams have been trying to carve out a slice of the ownership pie of professional cycling that comes via TV rights and other sponsorship deals.\nSince racing bikes began as a professional endeavor more than a century ago, those are mostly held by the race promoters, with the biggest control today in the hands of family-owned ASO.\nAll the profits generated from the Tour and its portfolio of races go directly into the pockets of the Amaury family.\nThis WorldTour relegation-promotion idea is the UCI’s way of trying to placate the teams by offering at least a three-year license guarantee without impacting ASO’s bottom line.\nAnd when teams and secondary organizers, frustrated after decades of being stonewalled, tried to organize something with the Saudis, the UCI played its nuclear card and said any team racing in a parallel league could be excluded from the WorldTour (and the Tour de France).\nNothing&#8217;s really changed\nThe richest teams are dominating more than ever. (Photo: Bernard PAPON / AFP)\nAs the second iteration of the relegation-promotion system comes to a close, nothing’s really changed.\nASO still holds all the real power and money. The richest and best-funded teams are winning all the races. The middle-of-the-pack teams are scratching out wins where they can, and the bottom-rung teams are barely hanging on.\nDespite all the hand-wringing, to completely miss out on the Tour de France remains pretty hard for a truly worthy team.\nAt the end of the last cycle, Israel-Premier Tech was facing relegation, and team owner Sylvan Adams was threatening to sue the UCI.\nThe cycling governing body, perhaps looking to avoid costly litigation, danced around the issue to find a compromise where the top-two ranked teams from the previous years’ ProTeam rankings — teams in cycling’s “second division” — would be allowed to start select races on the WorldTour calendar, including the Tour de France, which is the only thing that the WorldTour license guarantees anyway.\nSo there’s often a race to finish within the top 18 over three years, and to “win” the ProTeam rankings for those left out.\nAnd then there are the prized wild card invitations that organizers dole out.\nFully expect legacy French team Cofidis to be at next year&#8217;s Tour de France, even if it falls out of the WorldTour this year.\nRelegation-promotion has provided a bit more clarity on how smaller aspiring teams can move up into the WorldTour, and there’s no denying that it actually adds some surprising plot twists to the end of the season.\nYet it does nothing to address the larger challenges for the sport, and perhaps even exacerbates them.\nThat’s the beauty and the brutality of the UCI’s rolling points model.\nA team like XDS-Astana can claw back from oblivion, while a legacy team like Cofidis can be muscled out by ambitious upstarts.\nFor nervous teams on the relegation bubble, the season doesn’t really end until the final points are tallied up after the very last race.\nAnd fans are left with this big, ugly mess called relegation-promotion.",

    "item_title": "7 Mistakes to Avoid When Teaching Yoga to Gen Zers on a College Campus",
    "item_subtitle": "Confidence is key.",
    "body_content": "As my last student walked out of the studio that Sunday, my inner critic was loud. I worried that the playlist I’d chosen wasn’t cool enough. I wondered if students liked the sequence enough to come back. I hoped they didn’t think it was weird that I’d led them through several rounds of channel-cleaning breathing.\nMy experience teaching yoga on a college campus to a population of students-slash-peers began shortly after I started my graduate program. Suddenly I had the opportunity to teach folks that I had seen around campus and offer them a chance to destress during finals week or find community while managing the loneliness of university life.\nAlthough teaching yoga on a college campus was a rewarding experience, it also came with its own set of challenges. Whether you’re an experienced teacher or a complete newbie, it can be quite the learning curve. But if teaching to a group of college kids sounds intimidating, don’t let that stop you. Campuses need dedicated instructors who want to share the gift of yoga.\nInstead, let these mistakes I made while teaching yoga to Gen Zers serve as lessons to support your own college teaching journey.\n7 Lessons from Teaching Yoga on a College Campus\nIt’s all about staying calm and confident. And don’t forget to ask your students how finals are going.\n1. Try Not to Make Assumptions About Your Students’ Needs\nI assumed that teaching a mostly younger age group would mean that my students wanted fast-paced flows—ones that would make them break a sweat. But the best feedback I received actually came after I taught a slower-paced flow, offering my students enough time to go deeper into each posture.\nRemember, college kids often have hectic schedules and attending a yoga class may be the only part of their day to unwind and slow down.\n2. Enforce Class Rules\nIt’s never fun to enforce class policies. It&#8217;s even less fun when it’s to a group of people around your age.\nWhenever students used their phones or showed up well past our gym’s late period cutoff, I let it slide. I didn’t want to be known as the bossy yoga teacher. Plus it just felt uncomfortable to tell someone my age what to do.\nBut I was actually doing a disservice to the rest of the class by staying quiet. As instructors, it’s important to cultivate a calming space free of distractions. Even though it may feel awkward, it’s okay to gently remind students to stay off their cell phones or to make sure that they arrive on time.\n3. Feel Free to Deviate From Your Planned Sequence\nStudents attending classes on a college campus can vary wildly from week to week. This meant that carefully planning out my sequences days in advance and teaching them exactly as-planned was not a great idea. Often, when I realized my class plan wasn’t working for my students, I didn’t feel confident enough to go off script.\nNow, I recognize how essential it is to be flexible. As instructors, we need to be able to tailor each class to the students who actually showed up that day, not the imagined ones in our heads.\n4. Don&#8217;t Be Afraid to Demo\nDemoing postures can be intimidating—and I tried to avoid it as much as possible. I worried that if I demoed Chaturanga or Upward-Facing Dog, my students would feel that I was talking down to them. But my lack of demos only led to confusion and I had to increase the number of cues I gave throughout class. If I had taken the time to demonstrate proper alignment, my students could have focused more on their breath, less on my constant cues.\n5. Cultivate Community\nMost colleges are broken into two semesters: fall and winter. I knew that the students I’d get to know in the first chunk of the year might not attend my class in a few short months. Because of this, I didn’t take the time to learn the names of all of my students, leading to a missed opportunity for connection.\nOne of the main reasons so many people turn to yoga is for its supportive community. No matter if a student shows up just once,or is a regular, we should try to foster community and connection with the people who take the time to attend our classes.\n6. Don&#8217;t Worry About Judgement\nTeaching yoga can be a vulnerable experience.\nFor me, this fact was exacerbated when I began teaching my peers. I constantly worried that my students were judging me, and I focused too much on how well-liked I was. This was simply my ego getting in the way.\nTeaching yoga is not a popularity contest—it’s a chance to connect with our students and support them through their yoga journey.\n7. Allow Time for Savasana\nWhile Gen Z is notorious for their very short attention spans (myself included), this doesn’t mean that we don’t appreciate the power of Savasana.\nI figured that my students didn’t have the patience to lay in stillness for minutes on end. I’d often keep Savasana to three minutes or less. But now I recognize that Savasana is one of the most important parts of a yoga practice. Savasana offers students the chance to go inward, recentering themselves before moving on with their day.",

    "item_subtitle": "Scarab adds an easier way to get a Made-in-Colombia steel bike, Silca tries to perfect the TPU tube, and more in bike tech.",
    "body_content": "Cycling media hasn&#8217;t been easy on Campagnolo over the last few years, and we&#8217;ve certainly questioned what&#8217;s going on at the brand. It seems, however, that they&#8217;re making strides as of late. We loved the new 13-speed Campagnolo Super Record wireless groupset. These new Super Record Ultra bits, though, are Campagnolo being Campagnolo. Can&#8217;t blame them.\nThat&#8217;s not all that&#8217;s new in This Week in Bike Tech. Silca has a new TPU tube it claims is the Ultimate version of what you&#8217;d easily find at your local bike shop. Northwave has a new insulated winter riding shoe. Colombia-based Scarab Cycles has a new, less-expensive trio of framesets and complete bike options, too.\nMeanwhile, Brompton has revised its e-bike lineup to make it lighter and easier to use. Woom has a new self-balancing kids bike. And Wolf Tooth has a user-repairable trio of new SPD-compatible pedals, including one of our favorites we&#8217;ve used in some time.\nWithout further adieu, here&#8217;s what is new, This Week in Bike Tech. See previous updates here.\nCampagnolo Super Record Ultra adds more carbon fiber, titanium, and yes, ceramic bearings\n\nCampagnolo told us at the launch of Super Record Wireless that they wanted to be the future of ‘sport luxury’, and boy do I think they’ve done it here. While the recently-launched 13-speed Super Record groupset was silently about the same price as a Shimano Dura-Ace or SRAM Red AXS grouspet, this Ultra group adds more carbon fiber, more ceramic bearings, and more Ultraness. All of it will save you just 81 grams, but wait, let me tell you how!\nThe changes start at the chainrings of all places, which adopt a carbon structure molded over aluminum teeth. Weight is said to go down by as much as 30 percent with the carbon structure while improving rigidity. The Super Record Ultra cassette takes the steel set of cogs from a Super Record 13 cassette and replaces them with titanium for a claimed weight savings of as much as 16 percent. Further, the Super Record Ultra bottom bracket gets ceramic bearings that saves three grams and promises some form of efficiency gain.\nI’m not going to pretend that the new Campagnolo Super Record Ultra groupset is anything you need to go out and buy. It’s even more expensive than the already-expensive Super Record wireless 13-speed groupset, but it&#8217;s just … Ultra. While none of this really seems to push the performance envelope, it sure does look cool. And in this case, I think that’s a-OK.\nCampagnolo says you’ll be able to buy all of this separately, which should ease any FOMO concerns for folks on the new Super Record 13 groupset. The Ultra chainrings will set you back $330, the new Ultra titanium cassette will set you back $620, and the Ultra bottom bracket will set you back $164.

No gears, no brakes, and no training wheels, just a bike that fundamentally teaches how to balance and shift their weight before adding brakes and gears. But what if you want a bike that’s self-balancing? Well, Woom has the first option I’ve seen to do just that.\nIt&#8217;s called the Woom Wow, and the best way to think of it is a pre-balance balance bike. Woom says the Wow is best for children 9 to 36 months old. It features self-centering handlebars and chunky tires that keep the bike upright. But while a standard balance bike removes the need to pedal or brake, the Wow makes it easy for a young child to get the hang of balance without needing to worry about steering at the same time.\nWoom says the Wow has no sharp edges around the bike, and is made of 98 percent recycled materials. Unlike a standard balance bike, however, the Wow is designed for indoor use only.\nThe Woom Wow comes in three colors: pop peach, dreamy sky, and soft sprout, all of which should be perfect for the millennial parents who’ll likely be buying these. The bike is priced at $199, but you could think of it as an early investment in turning your kid into the next Tadej Pogačar or Marianne Vos.\nBuy now at woom.com\nSilca Ultimate TPU tubes could be the ideal answer to ditch your tubeless setup once and for all\n\nSilca, the ultimate purveyor of the most marginal of gains, has turned its attention to TPU tubes. The tube, which is called the Silca Ultimate TPU tube, absolutely seems like the Silca version of a TPU tube, however, in more ways than one. And of course, Silca makes all the claims of performance improvements you expect from them: a savings of 2-4 watts over a rubber tube, and within 0.2 watts of a latex tube.\nWhat makes this TPU tube interesting when compared to other TPU tubes is the use of a heavier aluminum valve and locking nut. Versus the plastic valves of other TPU tubes, this will work with removable valve cores and will work with an electric pump without the valve melting from the heat (which I’ve done!). Silca still recommends you inflate the tubes in 15 PSI increments to let the tubes cool down, however.\nThere is a growing legion of TPU tube users who swore off tubeless tire installation, and will almost certainly love the idea of a TPU tube that’s nearing perfection. Most TPU tubes use a fairly delicate-feeling plastic valve, which I think is fine if this is a backup fix in your saddle bag. But if you’re all in on TPU tubes, then the aluminum valves here are worth considering.\nThe Silca Ultimate TPU tube is available in a 24 to 43 mm wide version with a 50 or 70 mm valve, or a gravel-centric 44 to 64 mm tube with a 50 mm valve. The smaller tubes weigh in at a claimed 45 g, while the larger tube weighs in at 62 grams. All of this optimization will cost you $39; see more at silca.cc.\nScarab Now Offers Production Sizes and a Ready-To-Paint Program (and stock sizing)\n(Photo: Scarab Cycles)\nThe Colombia-based Scarab Cycles has introduced what it calls a Ready to Paint (RTP) program. Unlike what you might expect from what’s called a ready-to-paint program, Scarab is introducing a faster, less-expensive way to get into the most popular versions of Scarab road, gravel, and mountain bikes. And it&#8217;s not even limited to just framesets either, as Scarab now has a complete bike build kit to match, too.\nRiders will be able to choose between a series of 10 pre-prepared solid, gradient, or orchid paint schemes. Bikes like the Paramo gravel bike and Santa Rosa road bike get six or seven sizes to choose from, while the Darien hardtail mountain bike gets a choice of four frame sizes. Want your bike to come ready to ride? Scarab offers just that in a ready to ride SRAM Rival or GX AXS build.\nI’ve truly enjoyed riding every Scarab I’ve had the chance to enjoy. Their Made-in-Colombia steel frames offered top-tier build craftsmanship and paint schemes that I feel are about as good as it gets, while the Made-in-Colombia story feels unique against the array of frame builders. This Ready to Paint program feels like a bit of a misnomer, but it gives you another way to access all of the things I loved about Scarab bikes, just faster and at a lower price point.\nPricing starts at $2,950 with a choice of frame sizes for the Scarab Santa Rosa road bike and Paramo gravel bike, while the Darien hardtail starts at $2,200. Complete builds go up from there, starting at $6,150.

Weights are down, with the lightest Brompton Electric T-Line weighing in at a lithe 14.1 kg (31 pounds, claimed) with its battery, or just 11.2 kg (24.7 pounds) without the battery. That makes it Brompton’s lightest e-bike yet, great if you’re a multi-modal commuter.\nEvery Brompton Electric model features its in-house e-Motique drive system. It uses a new hub-driven motor delivering as much as 24 Nm of torque (or 30 Nm with the Electric G-Line) with a front-mounted 345 Wh battery that offers up to 90 km (55 miles) of range. All of it is controlled via a handlebar controller, with further information available via the Brompton Electric app.\nRegardless of whether you prefer a front-wheel drive or rear-wheel drive e-bike (I sound like I’m talking about cars), the new rear hub drive will absolutely balance the weight of the bike better than the outgoing front drive bike, making it slightly easier to carry when folded up.\nPrices start at £2995, while the top-of-the-range Brompton Electric T-Line titanium bike now retails at £5799. Pricing is yet to come for the USA, unfortunately.\nBuy now at Brompton.com\nNorthwave Celsius XT Arctic GTX winter shoe is a convincing argument to not ride indoors\n\nFolks, winter is right around the corner. And while I know more and more folks are opting to ride indoors rather than braving the elements, Northwave has continued to update its cold-weather shoe called the Northwave Celsius XT Arctic GTX. I’m not sure this is going to convince anyone to get off the indoor trainer this winter, but there appear to be some helpful changes.\nThe shoe uses a new PFAS-free Gore-Tex Cirrus XT 4L outer material, a PFAS-free waterproof membrane, and Primaloft Gold Eco insulation. Northwave has opted for a low-cut upper material, with just a neoprene gaiter to keep grit and spray out of the inside of the shoe. There’s also a new fit with a wider toe box area, fit for thick socks, and a zip closure to make the shoe easier to get out of when everything is wet.\nUnderneath, you get a set of rubber lugs, a two-bolt cleat mount for pedals like Shimano SPD. All things considered, I dig the low cut of this shoe with a neoprene gaiter, simply because the lower cut feels more like a standard shoe you’re using through the year.\nAt €269.99 / $309.99 / £239.99, this isn&#8217;t a cheap option but it is a statement against turbo trainers and weather apps.

    "item_title": "Pumpkin Is an Anti-Inflammatory Superfood—Here’s Why You Should Eat More of It, According to Nutritionists",
    "item_subtitle": "Pumpkin is packed with antioxidants, fiber, and nutrients that fight inflammation and aid recovery. Experts weigh in.",
    "body_content": "When you search for anti-inflammatory foods, most results suggest adding tomatoes, green leafy vegetables, strawberries, whole grains, and fatty fish like salmon to your diet. While these are fantastic recommendations, they’re a bit uninspiring. When I learned that pumpkin has anti-inflammatory properties, I was pleasantly surprised and grateful that I already had the plump gourd in my cupboard.\nI buy canned pumpkin every week to prepare frozen treats for my pup, Ollie, because research shows that the fiber content in pumpkin (about three grams per cup) can promote better digestion and combat diarrhea in dogs.\nAfter speaking with two sports dietitians, I learned that pumpkin is also great for humans. Here&#8217;s how adding more pumpkin to your diet can aid your overall health and performance.\nHow Inflammation Affects the Body\nInflammation is the body’s immune response to an illness or injury. It can occur outside the body—like if you scrape a knee and get a scab—or inside the body due to a variety of health or lifestyle reasons, such as having an underlying disease like obesity, sleeping poorly, eating a diet high in processed foods, drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, or over-exercising and straining your muscles.\nTo heal, the body releases a range of substances (mainly hormones and inflammatory molecules) that dilate blood vessels to help blood and immune cells reach the injured tissue. This process facilitates healing, but it can also irritate nerves along the way, causing pain, swelling, and redness near the affected tissue.\nShort-term inflammation, which is sudden and temporary, is typically no big deal, but long-term chronic inflammation (which can persist for months, even years) can be a huge problem. If left untreated, the body can’t heal. The inflammation will compound, which can lead to serious health issues (such as stroke and cancer), an impaired immune system, and, in the case of overtraining, muscle fatigue, impaired performance, and a higher risk of injuries, says Allison Childress, a sports dietitian and associate professor in the department of Nutritional Sciences at Texas Tech University.\nWhy Is Pumpkin Such a Potent Anti-Inflammatory Food?\nTo recover quickly and lower your risk for certain diseases, you want to eat foods that can naturally reduce inflammation, says Natalie Allen, a dietitian and clinical associate professor of nutrition and dietetics in the School of Health Sciences at Missouri State University.\nPumpkin Has a High Antioxidant Profile\nPumpkin is loaded with antioxidants like beta-carotene, substances that prevent or delay cell damage, says Allen. They do this by reducing oxidative stress, a condition where molecules called free radicals grow out of control and damage your organs and tissue, says Childress. This, in turn, lowers levels of inflammation in your body, which is crucial not only for your overall health but for muscle recovery as well.\nAfter a strenuous workout, your muscles experience mild inflammation, and eating foods with antioxidants can reduce it, Allen explains. The result? Faster recovery and fewer injuries.\nPumpkin Is Nutrient-Dense\nThe next perk: pumpkin is full of fiber. Research shows that fiber enhances the diversity of your gut microbiome, the community of microbes that live in your digestive tract, helping decrease inflammation in your body, says Childress.\nPumpkin is a great source of potassium (one cup of canned pumpkin contains 505 mg of potassium, 15 and 20 percent of the recommended daily value for men and women, respectively), which is an important electrolyte your body expels through your sweat, says Childress. Replenishing electrolytes after an intense workout can “reduce exercise-related inflammation and muscle soreness,” she says. It can also prevent muscle cramps, adds Allen.\nAdditionally, one cup of pumpkin contains about 11 mg of vitamin C; that’s roughly 13 percent and 15 percent of the daily recommended value for men and wommen, respectively. “When we think about soft tissue repair, like ligaments and tendons and muscles, vitamin C is a key nutrient,” says Childress. As long as you&#8217;re also eating enough protein, she adds, consuming vitamin C can help your muscles, bones, and cartilage recover and grow.\nHow Much Pumpkin Do You Need to Reap Its Anti-Inflammatory Benefits?\nRoughly half to one cup per day. However, for many, this much pumpkin isn’t realistic, Allen says. So you can aim to hit these daily recommended values by consuming a mix of vitamin A sources, including sweet potatoes, carrots, squash, and peppers. The goal is to eat about 5.5 cups of orange vegetables each week.\nThe Best Ways to Add Pumpkin to Your Diet\nPumpkin isn’t just for pies—it can be added to so many snacks and meals.“Pumpkin purée, in my professional opinion, is as good as if you got a pumpkin, roasted it, and puréed it yourself,” says Childress.\nSo, add a cup of pumpkin purée to a smoothie, make protein bites or balls using a mix of rolled oats, pumpkin purée, pumpkin pie spice, flour, and chocolate chips or nuts. You can spread pumpkin purée over a piece of toast and drizzle it with honey, peanut butter, almond butter, or Greek yogurt.\nAdd a half cup to your morning oatmeal, add it into your pancake mix, or whip up a pumpkin hummus for an afternoon snack. Or, hey, do what I do for my dog and freeze a dollop of pumpkin alongside Greek yogurt and peanut butter (it’s actually extremely tasty).\nYou can also cook real pumpkin as you would spaghetti squash—carve out the seeds and strings, pour some olive oil on it, and roast it in the oven for about 45 minutes at 350℉. As for pumpkin seeds, you can toss them in salads, parfaits, or trail mix, Allen recommends. Just make sure to chew them thoroughly; otherwise, they’ll pass right through you, and you&#8217;ll lose out on the benefits, says Childress.\nWhen Is the Best Time to Eat Pumpkin?\nAllen says the best time to eat pumpkin is within an hour after working out, especially when paired with a protein or carbohydrate, because your body is primed to absorb nutrients more effectively, says Allen.\nBut if you miss that window, don’t worry. Pumpkin is just as nutritious any time of day, says Allen. “It’s a very nutrient-rich food and you don’t need very much of it to get a lot of bang for your buck,” she says.\nWant more Outside health stories? Sign up for the Bodywork newsletter.

    "item_subtitle": "Kilian Jornet has set a new benchmark in insane endurance feats.",
    "body_content": "If you think your recent Strava stats are impressive, go check out the recent uploads by Kilian Jornet.\nJornet just completed his crusade to climb all 72 accessible 14,000-foot-plus peaks in the lower 48 of the United States, and to ride his bike between them.\nHis 490-hour &#8220;States of Elevation&#8221; project took him from Colorado, through Utah, Nevada, California, all the way up to Washington. It spanned 31 consecutive days.\nAll told, the crazed Catalan traveled 5,100km (3,200 miles) and amassed more than 123,000m (400,000 feet) of gain. Some 4,100 of those kilometers (2,570 miles) were by bike.\nOn average, this superhero of endurance ran a marathon and rode a Tour de France stage every day for a month.\nAnd sleep? Who needs it? Jornet got around four to six hours per night on a mattress in the back of his crew&#8217;s R.V.\n\nThe total &#8220;States of Elevation&#8221; upload garnered some serious Strava swag.\nIt was an awe-inspiring feat of bloody-minded grit and endurance.\nBut be wary of taking inspiration from the 37-year-old&#8217;s training and nutrition strategies.\nJornet rolled out of Colorado for day 1 with no specific training. This mountain runner had ridden his bike outside “two or three times all year.”\nHe forwent high-carb and fueled with an olive-oil-based nutrition strategy that would make even the sternest stomachs turn.\nHere&#8217;s how he got away with it.\nThe Pogačar-meets-Merckx of mountain athletics\nJornet is multiple winner of Spain&#8217;s famous Zegama trail race. (Photo: Gari Garaialde/Getty Images )\nWondering who the heck this crazy Kilian character is?\nWell, he’s part man, part mountain goat.\nJornet grew up in a hut perched on top of the Pyrénées, climbed his first mountain at age 3, and hasn’t stopped summiting since.\nHe’s won the “triple crown” of ultra running – USA&#8217;s Western States 100 and Hardrock, and the Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc. He became the youngest ever winner of the latter in 2008 when he took the &#8220;W&#8221; at age 20.\nJornet&#8217;s also harvested the most prized &#8220;sub ultra&#8221; races, too, including Sierre-Zinal and Zegama-Aizkorri.\nIn short, he’s the Pogi of trail and ultra running, and the Merckx of mountain climbing.\nThe Catalan counts speed records on the world’s most notorious peaks, including a controversial double ascent of Everest without oxygen.\nBeyond that, he’s a world champion ski-mountaineer, environmental campaigner, and owns the eco-friendly trail shoe company, NNormal.\nWant to do a big bike challenge? Don’t do what Jornet did\nJornet had barely ventured beyond the indoor trainer before his epic month-long adventure.  (Photo: Nick Danielson &#8211; States of Elevation)\nJornet’s &#8220;States of Elevation&#8221; wasn’t his first near-unfathomable feat.\nIn 2023, he climbed 177 3,000-meter peaks in the Pyrénées in eight days. One summer later, he summited all 82 of the 4,000-meter mountains in the Alps in less than three weeks.\nBut Jornet&#8217;s 2025 traverse of the roof of the U.S. would test him to a whole new level.\nAlthough Jornet has a history with the bike – he pedaled through sections of his Alpine project last summer, for example – he’d barely ventured beyond his indoor trainer all year.\nIt&#8217;s a proposition that would have a cycling coach shudder.\n“I didn’t know how I’d feel or experience the bike rides,&#8221; Jornet said this week in a video recap. &#8220;I’ve never been on the bike that long.\n&#8220;I train on the bike indoors for heat training or recovery,&#8221; Jornet said. &#8220;But this year I’d taken the bike out maybe two or three times before the trip. Then I was riding 200 miles a day in the desert with high temperatures and strong headwinds.\n&#8220;But I really enjoyed it.”\nThe bikes Jornet rode on his insane adventure\nJornet used a Trek Madone and Trek Checkpoint for his multi-surface adventure. (Photo: Nick Danielson — States of Elevation)\nAfter riding a Wilier for his Alpine adventure last year, Jornet teamed up with Trek for his U.S. project.\nThe multi-surface course required a Madone road bike with clip-on aero bars, and a Checkpoint gravel bike. They were specced with SRAM RED groupsets and Bontrager Aeolus wheels.\nJornet said this week he learned to love his bike rides, and that’s just as well.\nHe spent around 180 hours on his two custom-painted Treks, split around 50-50 road and gravel.\nThe effort included a five-day ride across the desolate flats that sprawl from the foot of the Sierra Nevada. He said on Strava that &#8220;counting train-cars felt like the most exciting part&#8221; of his 1,400km, 62-hour crossing.\nLater in the project, he rode 700km in back-to-back rides north through Oregon and toward Washington.\nThe unconventional approach to training – and why Jornet got away with it\nJornet scaled Washington&#8217;s notorious Mount Rainier at the end of his project. (Photo: Nick-Danielson &#8211; States of Elevation )\nTake inspiration from Jornet’s accomplishment, but apply his training method with caution.\nOnly a near-superhuman with two decades of ultra-endurance could ride that much after barely taking their bike outside for a year.\nIndeed, Jornet told CyclingWeekly, he&#8217;d done no specific training.\nJornet’s minimal indoor riding had been far from taxing, too. If his Strava uploads are complete, this mountain runner was pedaling low intensity for only two-to-three hours per week\nAny “normies” following a similar no-prep approach would be on the fast track to the physiotherapist.\nMuscles, ligaments, and tendons would end up as ruined as the undercarriage.\nThat said, Jornet is no normal athlete.\n&#8220;The rules&#8221; don&#8217;t apply when you&#8217;ve got the GOAT gene and have been training 20 hours per week for years.\nIn 2025 alone, Jornet already cruised around a mountain marathon in three hours, placed second behind only Jim Walmsley at a 75-mile race in Italy, and set the sixth fastest time on record when he ran to third at the Western States 100 miler.\nHis enormous engine and freakish resilience saved him from overuse.\n“The body, it’s crazy how much it adapts to things. It felt rough in the beginning, my body was tight, it was fighting all the things – the effort, the altitude, the dry air, everything,&#8221; Jornet said. &#8220;Then after a week it stopped fighting and started to adapt.\n&#8220;When I was doing the Norman’s [13 14,000-foot summits in Sierra Nevada – ed] I slept for one and a half hours in 56 hours, and I didn’t feel that tired. I felt like my body was taking it and saying ‘that’s cool.’&#8221;\nThe fueling: Less gels, more olive oil\nThe &#8220;olive oil shot&#8221; set tongues wagging across social media. (Photo: Nick Danielson — States of Elevation)\nJornet used decades of endurance to power his way around the &#8220;14ers,&#8221; and he used decades of nutritional experimentation to fuel it, too\nHe relied on a 50 percent carb / 50 percent fat strategy he’d dialed in over thousands of hours of low-intensity activity.\nThe vegetarian athlete munched on a moving feast of cookies, candies, and a custom mash-up of avocado, coconut oil, nuts, dates, and banana. Cheese or Nutella sandwiches, and peanut M&amp;Ms, became his go-to trail-side snacks.\nIt was whole-food, fat-heavy feeding that butts up against the hype for high-carb.\nIndeed, pounding thousands of calories of pure CHO only applies when the engine burns hot. It was redundant and unsustainable for Jornet&#8217;s month-long 100bpm bubble.\n&#8220;During a race, for example, I would eat a gel every 20 minutes or 30 minutes. Here, it was very rare I would eat a gel,&#8221; Jornet said.\nAnd on the topic of quick energy hits – Jornet addressed those Instagram reels of him slugging shots of olive oil.\n“A picture is always taken out of context,&#8221; Jornet told CyclingWeekly. &#8220;Olive oil and coconut oil have more calorie density. I’m spending 9,000 calories per day. I need to replace all of those.\n&#8220;I put a bit of olive oil or coconut oil in the water as a way to get more.”\nTotal calories – and calorie density – are king for such ultra-endurance escapades.\nBut before you go guzzling olive oil during the Unbound XL or The Traka, make sure your gut can tolerate it first. The porta-potties will thank you later.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nA post shared by Kilian Jornet (@kilianjornet)",

    "item_subtitle": "The two hikers were attacked by a grizzly bear while on a ten-mile out-and-back route in British Columbia's Gregor Mountains.",
    "body_content": "A  mother grizzly bear attacked a pair of hikers in British Columbia, but both are expected to survive after being treated at a nearby hospital. The attack occurred on October 12 while the duo was hiking Farm Cabin Trail in the McGregor Mountains, a roughly ten-mile out-and-back route that leads to a remote alpine cabin.\nBritish Columbia’s Conservation Officer Service (COS) reported on Facebook that the hikers were seriously injured after encountering a grizzly sow with two cubs. In light of the incident, the trail has been closed until further notice.\n“Following an investigation, the COS Predator Attack Team determined the bear’s actions were defensive,” said COS. “Due to the location and nature of the incident, no action will be taken against the bears.”\n\nBear attacks on humans are rare, but can be serious. Defensive attacks by female bears, or sows, are particularly common in late spring, when they are hyper-protective of their newborn cubs. According to the North American Bear Center, 70 percent of all fatal attacks by grizzly bears, specifically, are instances of female bears defending their cubs. Adult bears of both sexes are often more aggressive in the autumn, when they enter a period known as hyperphagia, dramatically increasing their food intake to stock up on calories in advance of winter hibernation.\nIn September, a bear attacked a hiker in Yellowstone National Park, which park officials believed to be a grizzly, and two more hikers were attacked in Alaska’s Kenai Fjords National Park later that month.\n\nIn August, Outside reported on two instances in Montana and British Columbia where hikers used bear spray to deter aggressive bears. The tool is considered a must-have deterrent when venturing into bear country, though questions remain about its efficacy compared to firearms in fending off charging bears.\nAlong with their post on the October 12 attack, the COS published a list of guidelines for those heading into bear country.\n\nStay Alert &amp; Make Noise: Talk, sing, or clap regularly to avoid surprising a bear—especially near streams, dense brush, or when visibility is low.\nTravel in Groups: Hike in groups whenever possible. Bears are less likely to approach larger groups.\nCarry Bear Spray: Keep bear spray accessible (not in your backpack) and know how to use it. It’s highly effective in deterring aggressive bears.\nKeep a Clean Camp: Store food, garbage, and scented items in bear-proof containers or hang them at least 10 feet off the ground and 4 feet from tree trunks.\nAvoid Bear Habitats: Steer clear of areas with fresh tracks, scat, or animal carcasses. These may indicate a bear is nearby.\nRespect Closures and Warnings: Obey trail closures and posted signs. They’re there for your safety and the bears’ protection.\nNever Approach Bears: No matter how calm or curious they seem, keep your distance. Use binoculars or zoom lenses for viewing.\n\nIn the instance of a bear encounter, the COS advises hikers, “Stay calm and don’t run. Speak in a calm voice and slowly back away.”\n“If the bear charges, stand your ground and use bear spray if necessary,” the organization adds.",

    "item_subtitle": "Conner Mantz recently shattered the U.S. men’s record at the Chicago Marathon. Mantz, 28, takes us inside his historic race.",
    "body_content": "On October 12, American distance runner Conner Mantz finished fourth place at the Chicago Marathon, crossing the line in 2:04:43. The time set a new U.S. record at the distance, shaving 55 seconds off of the previous best, set in 2002 by Khalid Khannouchi. Mantz, 28, describes what it was like to set the new mark. \nIt hit me with about 4 kilometers to go that I was on pace to break the American marathon record. I remember having a really good feeling because I knew I could keep my current pace and go sub-2:05. I was running with Alex Masai of Kenya at the time—we had been working together since about mile 19—and I remember thinking how special it was that everything was finally coming together at this race.\nI&#8217;ve struggled at the Chicago Marathon before—things hadn&#8217;t come together for me here in the past. There are so many things that can go wrong in the final part of a marathon. So to have this confidence in my ability is something I will always remember.\nI can also remember being on the starting line and seeing the size of the crowds. And at some points along the first part of the race, I could hear people cheering my name. I had forgotten just how many people come out to cheer at the Chicago Marathon. It gives you a huge boost to see that type of energy.\nConner Mantz celebrates his American marathon record in Chicago  (Photo: Geoff Stellfox/Getty Images)\nAnother memory, at mile 12, really stands out. My old college teammate Rory Linkletter of Canada ran up to me and said, &#8220;we are having such a blessed day,&#8221; and I responded by saying, &#8220;I knew you would catch up to me.&#8221; It was a special moment to be running with an old teammate and a friend I&#8217;ve been racing against for the last 13 years.\nBut my race wasn&#8217;t totally perfect. I struggled with grabbing my fluids and nutrition at the feed stations. I would slow down to make sure I didn&#8217;t lose my fluid, and I&#8217;d give up a few seconds. I know I can practice this and get better.\nAnd the first miles felt much harder than normal. I was surprised at the speed we were going that early. I didn&#8217;t feel as smooth as I would have liked, but I still managed to race with a very calm mentality. I tried really hard to be a relaxed runner. I knew that the pack would take me to the pace I wanted to keep. So I was slow to react to any changes in pace or any surges by other runners. And I think this kept my heart rate lower in those early miles. I wasn&#8217;t pushing—instead, I was calculated. I was holding back because the marathon is a long event.\nI tried to control the group less than I have in past races. Sometimes you need to control what&#8217;s going on in a race, but at Chicago I was very set on just following whatever the pace runners out front did for the first 14 to 16 miles. When we were running with a tailwind, we&#8217;d be faster than record pace, and when he hit a headwind, we&#8217;d slow down, sometimes by as much as ten seconds a mile. I&#8217;d find myself sometimes thinking, I should push more. I should go faster. I&#8217;m feeling good. But I&#8217;d always decide to hold back and just stay with the pacers. The risk goes up when you push—the reward goes up, too, of course. But for me, the calculation was how do I not risk too much? I kept thinking: I&#8217;m on American record pace. I want to leave today with an American record. I don&#8217;t want to risk it and lose the big goal. \n\nMy big goal was the American record, because at Boston I had run 2:05:08 (Note: that time was deemed ineligible due to the Boston course&#8217;s elevation profile). I announced in June that I was going to chase the American record at Chicago, so that did put more pressure on me. But in the back of my mind, I also had stretch goals that were harder to achieve than the record. My major stretch goal was to break 2:04. I didn&#8217;t tell anybody about it except for my coach and one of my training partners.\nHaving that stretch goal made chasing the record easier for me. If I wasn&#8217;t hitting the pace for my stretch goals, I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be stressed out, because I&#8217;d probably be on pace for the American record.\nThere were moments throughout the race when I was like, This is going to be awesome, and others when it was like, Oh crap. These feelings came in waves, and they would shift with the pace. But at 4 kilometers to go is when I knew it, like, I got this. I try not to ever celebrate before the finish line. But I allowed myself to not worry anymore. I was just happy and confident.\nAs told to Frederick Dreier. This interview was edited for length and clarity.",

    "body_content": "For our Winter 2025 Editors’ Choice trip, Outside’s gear team needed a trail system that was equipped for a wide variety of cross-country ski equipment testing. But we also wanted terrain that would challenge a battery of snowshoes, winter boots, and apparel with icy climbs and deep powder. For our wish list of wintery conditions, there was no better place to test than the Appalachian Mountain Club’s 100-Mile Wilderness in northern Maine.\nMedawisla&#8217;s trails cross over the region&#8217;s frozen ponds and lakes \nAMC’s Maine Woods Initiative is responsible for permanently protecting the Wilderness area’s 114,000 acres of forest and transforming it into a multi-use recreation hub with conservation at its heart. It lies deep in the center of the largest contiguous expanse of undeveloped forest in the eastern United States. In short, it’s extremely remote. Even when flying into Bangor, the nearest city with an airport, accessing the remote trail system is an adventure that involves long drives on snow-covered backroads—some of them primarily meant for snowmobiles. But with that isolation comes some of the most beautiful natural landscapes in the Northeast, and killer stargazing. (It is New England’s first certified International Dark Sky Park, after all.)\nOur team basecamped at Medawisla, AMC’s largest off-grid lodge, and slept in the wood-framed behemoth&#8217;s smaller surrounding cabins. Each comes equipped with a woodstove, real mattresses, and running water—unexpected luxuries so far from civilization. At the main lodge, warmed by a roaring fire, the team planned its weekend of adventuring while a snowstorm dumped several inches of fresh powder outside.\nShaw Mountain, to the south of Medawisla, is a snowshoers paradise.\nWith help from cross-country ski category manager, Kelly Bastone, the Outside team planned routes along the region’s 30 miles of groomed cross-country ski trails, some of which crossed the area’s frozen-over lakes and ponds. Over two days of non-stop skiing, we hardly broke ground on the additional 80 miles of groomed trail connecting Medawisla to the other lodges, Little Lyford and Gorman Chairback. Heading south to Shaw Mountain, we unclipped from our skis and strapped on snowshoes for a six-mile, 1,000 foot climb in deep powder with panoramic views of the 100-Mile Wilderness at the top.\nAlong the way, we tested dozens of cross country skis and boots and a wardrobe’s worth of winter apparel and footwear. Only the very best gear earned our coveted Editors’ Choice badge after the weekend of testing. Top marks in the cross country ski department went to Rossignol’s X-Ium Premium+ Skate SX, an expert-level classic ski that’s fun and fast enough to place on the podium. We were equally taken with the Flylow Mia Jacket, which replaced just about all other midlayers in our gear closet thanks to its versatility, and the Mountain Hardwear Airmesh Long Sleeve Hoody, a shockingly fast-wicking and warm fleece that weighs in at around six ounces.\nMedawisla Lodge is a cozy escape from the blustery Maine winter\nOur winter editors’ choice trips sometimes end up being week-long sufferfests in sleet and driving wind, so we were pleasantly surprised by our experience at Medawisla, where we enjoyed brilliantly blue skies and sunshine. Apart from the luxury of having 30 miles of trail groomed multiple times a day, the staff served up two daily hot meals (with packed brown bag lunches), and between testing trips, we made good use of the lodge’s wood-burning sauna. But even if we were snow camping on the ground for the entire trip, the 100-Mile Wilderness would be worthy of repeat visits from our crew: from pristine trail conditions to unmatched solitude amid deep pines, this slice of northern Maine is a true winter gem.",

    "item_title": "You Probably Have Poor Running Form. Here’s How to Check.",
    "item_subtitle": "Four exercises from a running medicine PT for assessing and addressing the source of your bad running form.",
    "body_content": "As a running medicine physical therapist, I frequently look at and assess running form in my clinic. Admittedly, I also find myself watching runners as they run by me at coffee shops, in the park, and on trails. While there is no such thing as perfect running form, there are people with an efficient stride and others who, well, look like a hot mess. When I see someone who has “bad form,” it is almost always an indicator that they have muscle weakness and range-of-motion deficits within their body.\nWhen runners come to the clinic for treatment, my team and I take them through multiple functional tests before looking at their running form on the treadmill. These tests help us assess potential weaknesses that might be contributing to their poor running form, injury history, or even poor performance. Here are a handful of my favorite functional tests that you can do yourself to help you identify and improve some of your own form issues.\nFor all of the tests below, you can stand in front of a mirror or film yourself doing them on your smartphone. Just make sure that you are able to see your entire body from head to toe. Running is a full body activity, and it is important to see how your body moves at the foot, knee, pelvis, trunk, and even head.\nTest 1: Single Leg Squat (Balance and Strength)\nWhy this test is important: When running, you are essentially jumping from one leg to the next. As you accept weight onto your leg, you have to bend at the knee to absorb and store that force. This causes you to do a single leg squat over and over.\nKnee injuries are the most common running injury, and when you cannot control the motion at your knee or foot, it often leads to iliotibial (IT) band syndrome, anterior knee pain, among other issues.\nHow to test: Stand on one leg with your hands on your hips, and lift the opposite leg up so your hip is at 90 degrees and your foot is flexed. Squat on the standing leg by bending your knee.\nDid you pass or fail? \nIf you have weakness in the hips, you will likely see that your knee moves into knee valgus (dives in) or your hip drops while doing this move. However, if you are losing your balance and your foot is pronating (collapsing in), you may also need to work on your foot and arch strength.\nForm issues you may have if this test is positive:\n\nKnee valgus (knee diving in)\nHip drop\nOverpronation\n\nHow to fix your form issues\n\nPerform a standing clam shell without shoes. This improves single leg glute strength. Focus on keeping your hips even, pushing into your great toe, and keeping your foot strong and balanced.\nImproving your cadence by 3–5% may activate your glutes slightly and decrease the knee valgus (knee diving in). To do this, first determine your current cadence by checking your running watch or counting how many times your right foot hits the ground in a minute and multiply by two. Then multiply your cadence by 0.03. For example, if your cadence is 155 steps/minute, multiply 155 x 0.03 = 4.65. You can then increase your cadence by approximately 4 steps to be 159 steps/minute. To practice this, you can download a free metronome app and set it to your desired cadence while running. I would focus on listening to the beat intermittently throughout your run. Once you are good at matching the beat, try finding a playlist with your desired cadence. The goal is to eventually move from using an external cue like the metronome to recognizing what the new cadence feels like in your own body.\n\nTest 2: Single Leg Heel Raise (Balance and Strength)\nWhy this test is important: When your foot hits the ground, fatigue in your lower leg muscles can alter mechanics and increase your risk for injury. The plantar flexors of the foot are active during push-off and must be strong enough to generate enough force to propel your body forward during gait. The single leg heel raise tests this muscle group&#8217;s strength and endurance.\nWithout strong plantar flexors, fatigue occurs more quickly, and common running injuries that involve the Achilles tendon and posterior tibialis become more likely.\n\nHow to test: Stand with one leg on a step and the opposite leg slightly behind you. Place your hands on your hips or finger tips against the wall or hold on to something for balance if you need to. Lift and lower your heel as high as you can slowly (ideally about 2-3 seconds to go up and down) and repeat 15-25 times.\nDid you pass or fail? \nDuring this test, we are looking for how many times you can lift and lower your heel, how high you are able to raise up onto your toes, and the quality of movement. Are you pushing off all of your toes or just a few of them? How is your balance? What is happening at the heel—is it wobbling or stable?\nYour goal is to be able to do 25 single leg heel raises with good control and height. You will “pass” if you can do at least 15 without difficulty and good control; however, 25 is ideal.\nForm issues you may have if this test is positive:\n\nDecreased hip extension\nIncreased vertical oscillation (bounce)\nKnee valgus (knee diving in)\nOverpronation\n\nHow to fix your form issues\nIf you are unable to do 10 single leg heel raises, then begin by practicing bilateral, eccentric heel raises. Lean against the wall with your forearms, and lift and lower your heels focusing on pushing off with all of your toes, minimizing the wobbling at the heel and slowly lowering down. Do 3&#215;10 reps 3x/week and slowly progress to single leg as your strength and endurance improves. Eventually you can even add weight.\nTest 3: Single Leg Glute Bridge (Strength)\nWhy this test is important: A single leg glute bridge assesses a lot at once if you pay attention. It can give you an idea if you have strong pelvic stability, what your posterior chain strength is, if you are more inclined to use your hamstrings, lower back, or glutes to extend your hips, and if you are tapping into your deep core or not.\nCompensation patterns are common in runners and this simple test helps us to sift through some of those patterns.\n\nHow to test: Perform this test on the floor. Lie on your back with your knees bent, your feet flat on the floor, and your arms at your sides. Extend one leg out and lift it to the level of your opposite, bent knee. Lift your hips off the ground and hold for 3-5 seconds then lower. Repeat 2-3 times on each side.\nDid you pass or fail? \nIn this test we are looking to see if you are able to keep your hips level when you lift your hips. If you are looking toward your knees, your hips should lift high enough that your thighs are in a straight line from knee to hip, but you should not be arching your back. Are you holding your breath? Do you get a cramp in your hamstrings? Can you perform the movement so that your hips lift off the ground enough?\nForm issues you may have if this test is positive:\n\nDecreased hip extension\nPoor running posture (how head, rib cage and trunk stack over pelvis)\nKnee valgus (knee diving in)\nHip drop\nHip adduction\n\nHow to fix your form issues\n\nIf you are holding your breath, then start paying attention. Holding your breath means that you are not using your deep core to its fullest potential, and it may even be impacting your pelvic floor. Actively think about inhaling and exhaling as you exercise.\nPractice glute bridges. Start with bilateral glute bridges putting a band just above the knees. Inhale, press into the band, and lift your hips up, maintaining a level pelvis and exhale while you lower. Focus on pressing your weight through your entire foot as you lift. Once you are able to perform this easily 3&#215;20 with good control, you can begin to practice single leg bridges.\n\nTest 4: Knee to Wall Test for Ankle Dorsiflexion (Mobility)\nWhy this test is important: Ankle dorsiflexion is crucial because without it, we compensate at the foot, ankle, knee, and hip. Decreased dorsiflexion can lead to overpronation, knee valgus, and hip adduction—all biomechanical issues that put runners at high risk for injury and decrease running efficiency.\n\nHow to test: You will need a tape measure and a wall for this test. Place the tape measure flat on the ground perpendicular to the wall. Stand facing the wall in a lunge position. Make sure that your foot and knee are pointing forward. Lunge forward toward the wall, keeping your foot and heel on the floor and bringing your knee closer to the wall. If your knee does touch the wall, bring your foot farther away. Measure the distance between your big toe and the wall at the point when your knee can touch the wall without your heel lifting. Repeat on both sides.\nDid you pass or fail? \n\nThere are two things to pay attention to here. What is the difference between your left and right, and what is the distance from your big toe to the wall? The ideal distance from your big toe to the wall (with your knee touching) is 10-15 cm.\nIf your ankle dorsiflexion is less than 10 cm and/or if there is a difference  more than approximately 2-2.5 cm between sides, you will need to improve your dorsiflexion.\n\nForm issues you may have if this test is positive:\n\nOverpronation\nDecreased hip extension\nHip adduction\nKnee valgus (knee diving in)\nHip drop\n\nHow to fix your form issues\n\nIf tightness is in the front of the ankle with a negative test, then the restriction is probably due to a lack of joint mobility. To improve this, you could do a self and dorsiflexion mobilization with a band. Tie a band in a loop and anchor it to something that will not move when it is pulled on. Typically the leg of a table, weight rack or bottom of the stairs works well. Repeat the test, but this time have one part of the band secured behind you, place your foot into the loop and have the other end of the band in place around the ankle joint. Repeat the test with the resistance of the band creating space in the joint.\nIf tightness is in the front of the ankle with a negative test, then the restriction is probably due to tightness in the plantar flexor muscles. To stretch these muscles, stand with one foot touching a wall and the other foot staggered behind you in a lunge position. Make sure that the toes of both feet are facing forward and your ribs are stacked over your pelvis to maintain good posture. You do not want to bend from the hips and stick your butt out. Maintain your heel on the ground and slightly lean forward creating a stretch in the back of the calf muscle. You can have your hands on the wall. Hold for at least 45-60 seconds and repeat 2-3x with your back knee straight then bent.",

    "item_subtitle": "The five profiles also demonstrate that sleep is nuanced, and the different elements of sleep likely all help shape your overall function and performance.",
    "body_content": "Since the first issue of the journal Sleep was published back in 1978, over 300,000 research studies have dug into the science of sleep. Many of these have been “single-association” studies, which connect a single element of sleep (i.e., nightly awakenings) with a single outcome (i.e., risk of cognitive decline). However, as we all know, sleep is complex and multifaceted.\nIn a study published this month in PLOS Biology, a global team of researchers set out to explore these intricacies and connect different elements of sleep with various outcomes. Their findings could help reveal how your unique sleep patterns influence your mood, mindset, and both your mental and athletic performance throughout the day—the study refers to these patterns as “profiles.”\nThe Study Identified Five Sleep Profiles\nThis study, titled &#8220;Identification of Five Sleep-Biopsychosocial Profiles with Specific Neural Signatures Linking Sleep Variability with Health, Cognition, and Lifestyle Factors,&#8221; relied on information from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The HCP collects a wide range of health data—including cognitive tests, brain scans, and self-reported sleep assessments—from thousands of participants.\nFor this study, researchers analyzed data from 770 young, healthy adults to examine how certain aspects of their health and performance corresponded to different attributes of their sleep. Participants reflected on their past month of sleep via a questionnaire, and the resulting sleep data were used to inform the five profiles.\n“It was important for me to go beyond ‘good’ versus ‘bad’ sleep. Sleep is multidimensional, and there are a lot of interindividual differences in sleep, health, and behavior,” says lead researcher Aurore Perrault.\nWhat Does Each Profile Say About Your Usual Sleeping Pattern?\nAfter analyzing the comprehensive HCP dataset, Perrault and her team identified five sleep profiles, each associated with specific behaviors.\nEvery sleep profile also correlated to a unique pattern of brain function, Perrault says, “suggesting that sleep experiences are reflected not just in health and behavior, but also in the brain’s wiring and activity.”\nProfile 1: Poor Sleep and Psychopathology\nThis profile was marked by poor self-reported sleep (taking a long time to fall asleep, finding sleep unsatisfying, waking up through the night due to pain or uncomfortable temperatures, etc.). It was associated with a higher likelihood of depression, anxiety, and negative affect—meaning emotions like fear, anger, and stress.\nProfile 2: Sleep Resilience and Psychopathology\nThis profile was defined by difficulty paying attention during the day and negative affect, but was not associated with reported sleep difficulties, potentially suggesting a certain amount of “sleep resilience.”\nProfile 3: Hypnotics and Sociability\nThis profile was characterized by the use of sleep aids—either prescribed or over-the-counter. It was related to worse visual memory and emotional recognition, but, surprisingly, high satisfaction with social relationships.\nProfile 4: Sleep Duration and Cognition\nWithin this profile, short sleep duration (less than six to seven hours a night) was associated with poor performance on cognitive tasks, delayed reaction time, and more aggressive behavior.\nProfile 5: Sleep Disturbance, Cognition, and Psychopathology\nThe final profile tied sleep disturbances and multiple awakenings with mental health issues, the use of substances like alcohol and cigarettes, and poor performance on cognitive tasks.\nIt’s important to note, Perrault adds, that every participant displayed all the profiles, scoring high, medium, or low in each one. For example, in general, people with lower levels of education tended to have higher combined scores in profiles 1, 4, and 5, while those with limited household financial resources scored higher in profiles 1 and 2.\nStudy Limitations\nThis study focused on young, healthy, and primarily white adults between the ages of 22 and 36, so Perrault notes that research on more diverse populations is needed to validate the findings. Future studies should also analyze data collected over a person’s lifespan for a more complete health profile; this study was just a snapshot of one point in time.\nWhat This Means for Your Sleep and Performance\nThis study reiterates and reinforces some existing sleep best practices, such as getting at least seven hours of sleep a night to support cognition. Across participants, cognitive functioning was more related to sleep duration than subjective (self-reported) sleep quality, meaning how long you slept the night before will probably have more sway over your brainpower than how well you think you slept.\nThe five profiles also demonstrate that sleep is nuanced, and the different elements of sleep likely all help shape your overall function and performance.\nWhile the research did not specifically study athletes, some inferences can be made about what its findings mean for physical performance. For example, those who have poor self-reported sleep (profile 1) may find that fear or stress gets in the way of their performance and benefit from tools to ease pre-race or pre-workout anxiety. In contrast, those who consistently sleep less than six to seven hours a night (profile 4) might struggle to respond quickly and benefit from exercises to speed up their athletic reaction time.\nMost importantly, this work reminds us of the importance of prioritizing sleep in general—especially during more active periods. “For athletes, sleep is especially crucial because it’s when the body does its deepest recovery work,” says Dr. Angela Holliday-Bell, a board-certified physician and certified sleep specialist who was not involved in this study. “Growth hormone peaks during deep sleep, repairing muscle tissue and helping the body adapt to training stress. Lack of sleep reduces reaction time, coordination, and endurance, all of which directly affect performance.”\nAs for how to improve your sleep, Holliday-Bell recommends maintaining a regular bedtime and wakeup time, crafting a relaxing wind-down routine, limiting caffeine and alcohol later in the day, and managing stress through a regular mindfulness or deep breathing practice. Better sleep—in all its many facets—starts with consistency, she says.\nWant more Outside health stories? Sign up for the Bodywork newsletter. Ready to push yourself?

    "item_title": "Prone to Falling on Trail? These Exercises Will Help Prevent Injury.",
    "item_subtitle": "Here's the best way to spill-proof yourself and, if you do take a tumble, minimize injury.",
    "body_content": "It happens to everyone at some point. One minute, you’re admiring the scenery from the trail, and the next, the ground is rising up to meet you as you sail through the air, boots over backpack. \r\nAt best, falling is mildly embarrassing and leaves you with a few minor scrapes and bruises. At worst, it leads to serious, hike-ending injuries, like sprains and fractures. \r\nOf course, accidents happen to even the most experienced and well-prepared hikers. But there are steps you can take to reduce your fall risk and to minimize the damage in the event you do take a spill. \r\nWhy We Fall \r\nMilica McDowell, D.P.T., physical therapist, exercise physiologist, and vice president of operations at Gait Happens, explains that there are external and internal factors that impact your fall risk. The external factors are the “environmental pieces that you can’t change and just have to be prepared for,” she says. A slippery surface, technical terrain, inclement weather, and poor visibility are all external factors. \r\nInternal factors are unique to you, the hiker. You have control over some but not all of them. One study on fall-related accidents among hikers found that a higher age seemed to increase a hiker’s fall risk. This isn’t surprising, considering strength, mobility, and balance tend to decline as we get older. The research also found that fallers had an above-average mean for body mass index (BMI) and a high rate of vision impairments. A separate study on adults ages 60 to 90 found a clear connection between falling (in general, not just while hiking) and big toe weakness.\r\nThen there are all the planning and equipment-related mistakes that can increase your chances of wiping out on the trail. A too-heavy or improperly packed backpack can throw off your sense of balance. Improper footwear can lead to slipping and leave your feet and ankles vulnerable. Even trekking poles, which are designed to provide support and aid balance, can just be one more thing to trip over if you don’t know how to use them properly. \r\n\r\nFall-Proof Your Gear\r\nWhen it comes to fall prevention, proper gear is the low-hanging fruit. You need a pack that fits you, but it also needs to be loaded so that the heavier items, like your tent or sleeping bag, are at the bottom of your bag “down by your pelvis and hips, where your big muscle groups are,” McDowell says. “If you have a higher load above your center of gravity, above your belly button, it increases your fall risk,” she says.\r\nIf you choose to use trekking poles, get a pair that’s easy to stow, and practice using them before heading out for a hike. “When I work with people who are learning to use them, they walk on flat terrain, not elevated terrain, to start. In some cases, I’ll have them walk on a treadmill with their poles. They really have to get comfortable with them before they take them out into more challenging terrain,” McDowell says. \r\nAnd, it should go without saying: Don’t hike in sneakers. You need the traction of a rugged tread and the protection of a stiff upper, especially if you&#8217;re prone to falling. The squishy foam of a running or walking shoe will add an element of instability and make it harder to feel the ground underneath you. Stick with a shoe or boot that’s specifically designed for the trail. \r\nFall-Proof Your Body \r\nIf Plan A is not to fall, Plan B is to recover from a fall relatively unscathed. One of the best ways to boost your resiliency and protect yourself from a sidelining injury is to strength train. \r\nMuscle mass acts as a cushion to your bones and connective tissue and provides shock absorption during a fall. “Strength training not only puts on muscle mass, but it also strengthens the bones themselves. So, we’re literally more resilient when we hit the ground,” says Jessie Duppler, P.T., D.P.T., creator of the Chain Reaction Strength Revolution program. “It also allows us to be stronger to get back up off the ground,” she adds, noting that when she works with clients on fall prevention, she often has them practice getting up off the ground. \r\nYour strength training routine should engage all the major muscle groups, but pay special attention to your hip and ankle strength and mobility. “Those are the muscles that really fire to keep us upright,” Duppler says. “If we have a weakness in one spot, the other spot has to work harder. And if we have weakness in both spots, then we tend to have a bigger propensity for falling.” \r\nTry these exercises for a stronger, more fall-proof hike. Pick a couple at a time to incorporate in your full-body strength-training sessions. \r\n\r\nLateral Step-Up \r\nOne of Duppler’s favorite moves for hikers is the lateral step-up, which requires hip and ankle mobility and builds lower-body and core strength. It’s also functionally relevant to backpackers who are constantly stepping up and down, testing the limits of their hip and ankle flexion and extension. You can do the lateral step-up with just your body weight, while wearing your pack, or holding a pair of dumbbells. \r\n\r\nStand beside a box or bench. (Duppler recommends a box height between 12 and 20 inches.) \r\nLift the foot that’s closest to the box and place it on top of the box. Push through your foot and extend your knee so that you’re standing on top of the box. Let the other foot hover next to the box. Keep your chest up, and your shoulders down and back. \r\nBend the knee of your standing leg and slowly lower your hovering foot to the ground. \r\nStep off the box. \r\nRepeat for 12 to 15 reps, then switch legs. Complete a total of two to three sets on each side. \r\n\r\nDownhill Forward Lunge and Angled Board Squat\r\nTraining on a slope helps you learn to manage your body weight going downhill, which is critical to fall prevention; some research shows that you’re more likely to fall while descending than ascending. Taking the forward lunge and the squat—two foundational strength exercises that engage the major muscle groups of the lower body—and performing them on a decline introduces a stability challenge that benefits hikers. \r\nDownhill Forward Lunge\r\n\r\nStart at the top of a ramp or hill. Stand with your feet hip-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand with your arms at your sides. Alternatively, you can use a barbell or wear your pack. \r\nKeeping your chest up and shoulders back, step forward with your right foot so that you’re moving down and toward the bottom of the slope. Bend both knees 90 degrees, keeping the front knee in line with your second toe. \r\nPush through the front foot to step back and return to a standing position. \r\nRepeat on the opposite foot. \r\nDo two to three sets of 10 to 12 reps on each foot. \r\n\r\n\r\nAngled board squats\r\n\r\nStand on an angled board or wedge with your feet around hip-width apart. Your heels should be slightly higher than your toes.\r\nHold a set of dumbbells at shoulder height. Alternatively, you can use a barbell or wear your pack. \r\nKeeping your chest up and back flat, hinge at your hips and push your butt back as you bend your knees into a squat. \r\nOnce you’ve reached the end of your range of motion, push through the soles of your feet to return to a standing position. \r\nRepeat for 10 to 12 reps. Do two to three sets. \r\n\r\nForward Lean \r\nStrong toes—especially strong big toes—can help you steady yourself and keep a little stumble from becoming a bigger fall. “Most falls occur when your center of mass is outside your base of support,” McDowell explains. “If you think about being able to essentially claw your toes into the ground, that prevents you from tipping over.” The forward lean, formally known as the “anterior fall envelope” among physical therapists, activates the toe flexors using just your body weight. \r\n\r\nStand facing a wall with your bare feet together, legs straight, and your arms at your sides. \r\nSlowly lean forward toward, going as far as you can while keeping your body in a straight line from your head to your heels. (The wall is there in case you need to catch yourself.)\r\nOnce you’ve gone as far as you can, push through the toes to return to your starting position. \r\nRepeat for 10 to 12 reps. Do two to three sets. \r\n\r\nFall-Proof Your Vision \r\nVision plays a huge role in balance. Duppler explains that you need to be able to divide your attention between what’s ahead of you and what’s on the ground and directly in front of you. Vision is also critical to proprioception, or understanding where your body is in relation to its surroundings. “We use our eyes to figure out where our feet are,” Duppler says. \r\nHikers should always wear sun protection and any doctor-prescribed corrective lenses. But beyond that, it’s possible to train the eyes. Duppler says that eye exercises train the “reflexes in our brain that help us with that ability to look near and far and change where we’re looking quickly. They also train the muscles in our eyes.” \r\nDuppler recommends doing the following exercises daily. \r\n\r\nFigure Eight \r\n\r\nExtend your arm in front of you and hold your thumb at eye level. \r\nUse your thumb to slowly draw a wide figure eight in the air. \r\nAs you make the figure eight, keep your eyes on your thumbnail. \r\nDo five figure eights with each hand. \r\n\r\nSide to Side \r\n\r\nExtend both arms in front of you and hold up both pointer fingers so that they’re about a foot apart. \r\nKeeping your eyes on your right finger, slowly turn your head to the left as far as you can while keeping the right finger in sight. \r\nThen change directions.

    "item_subtitle": "Comparing Pogačar's obliteration of Il Lombardia with his other recent bests shows the peloton has got a serious problem.",
    "body_content": "In my last Power Analysis column, I explained how the professional peloton can beat Tadej Pogačar. When it came to the 119th edition of Il Lombardia, they didn’t listen. Any guesses at the outcome? The world champion destroyed them all.\nThe final monument of the 2025 season made its way from Como to Bergamo along a 241.5km route that included 4,639 meters of climbing. The first 150km were a warmup for the mountainous finale that included the Passo Della Crocetta (11.7km at 5.8%), Passo di Ganda (9.3km at 7.1%), and Colle Aperto (1.3km at 7.4%).\nEveryone knew that Pogačar would attack on the Passo di Ganda, which topped out at 31km to go. So what did they do to prepare for the inevitable attack? A few riders had the right idea, such as Quinn Simmons who attacked at kilometer zero. &#8220;Captain America&#8221; helped form the 14-rider breakaway that stayed out front for the majority of the day.\nBy the time they reached the finish, Simmons had averaged 357w (NP 390w) for nearly six hours. The craziest part? He didn’t even finish on the podium. The American finished 4th…but let’s rewind to 150km to go.\nRed Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe were pacing in the peloton, not UAE Team Emirates-XRG with the overwhelming race favorite in Pogačar. Instead, the team of Primož Roglič were doing the lion’s share of the work. Their best result at the end of the day: 22nd place. But I digress.\nThe way that the race was playing out, the only way to beat Pogačar was to be far enough ahead at the bottom of Passo di Ganda that you were still within touching distance following the inevitable catch. Simmons was the last survivor of the breakaway, and he began the Passo di Ganda with a 2:45 lead. However, Jay Vine and UAE Team Emirates-XRG began mowing down the American, launching Pogačar from the lead group with a few kilometers to go on the climb.\nSimmons’ gap evaporated, and it wasn’t long until Pogačar was solo off the front of Il Lombardia. There wasn’t much else to say over the final 40km. Remco Evenepoel and Michael Storer were the best of the rest on the Passo di Ganda, finishing second and third, respectively, in Bergamo. Simmons held on for 4th, while Isaac Del Toro won the small group sprint for fifth.\nPogačar’s dominance is, of course, utterly impressive. But we’re not here to focus on yet another Pogačar race win. Instead, we’re here to analyze Pogačar’s 2025 season and how he has progressed (or regressed) from previous years.\nIl Lombardia\nPogačar blew everyone&#8217;s doors off &#8211; again &#8211; at Il Lombardia. (Photo: Luca Bettini &#8211; Pool/Getty Images )\nPogačar’s attack on Passo di Ganda was one of the best climbing performances of his entire career. We’re not joking. Just because he seemed to win so easily doesn’t mean that he wasn’t performing at his best. Before the world champion launched, the pace was already around 7w/kg in the lead group.\nOscar Onley was one of the riders following the UAE Team Emirates-XRG train, and he averaged 6.7w/kg for the first half of the Passo di Ganda. Keep in mind, this was the shallower part of the climb with an average gradient of 6.7%. Onley averaged 26kph during this section of the climb, meaning that he was saving at least 10-20w in the draft.\nWhen Vine finished his pull, Pogačar launched at 950w and rode at 470w for six minutes to blow out his gap. The world champion averaged 390w for the final 49:44 of Il Lombardia, but the normalized power was significantly higher when you factor in the corners, attacks, and descents.\nLet’s take a closer look at Pogačar’s effort on the Passo di Ganda.\nBest performances of 2025\nThe climb of Passo di Ganda is Pogačar’s best 20-minute w/kg performance of the season. There were a few comparable performances in the Tour de France, such as his ascents of the Hautacam and Mont Ventoux, but those climbs were significantly longer at 35-55 minutes.\n\nPogačar – Passo di Ganda\n\nTime: 21:19\nEstimated Average Power: ~465w (7.2w/kg)\nVAM: 1,869 Vm/h\n\nThe Tour’s stage 13 time trial on Peyragudes is the most comparable performance to Pogačar’s Passo di Ganda ascent. But even then, we are talking about a completely fresh effort versus a race-winning attack after 4,500 kJs. The world champion pushed ~7.5w/kg for 17 minutes and 19 seconds on Peyragudes, and an estimated 7.2w/kg for 21 minutes 19 seconds on Passo di Ganda. Pogačar had also crashed a few days before the Peyragudes effort, so it’s unlikely he was 100% for the effort.\n\nPogačar – Peyragudes\n\nTime: 17:19\nEstimated Average Power: ~475w (7.5w/kg)\nVAM: 1,960 Vm/h\n\nIt is also worth noting that Pogačar’s effort didn’t finish at the top of Passo di Ganda. He still had 40km to go, and he was able to push 350-400w for the remainder of the race. Of course, this is only a Zone 3 effort for him, but it is still 5.5-6w/kg after 5,000 kJs.\nHow much Pogačar has improved since 2023\nPogačar ran riot in the Pyrenees at the 2025 Tour de France and could do it again in 2026. (Photo: LOIC VENANCE/AFP via Getty Images )\nThe pro peloton doesn’t want to hear this: Pogačar is still improving.\nWhile it’s obvious that he has improved since 2019, we can even see the progress from one year to another. Take 2023 for example, when Pogačar climbed the Passo di Ganda in 23:07. It was an incredibly impressive effort at the time, but it was nearly two minutes slower than this year’s effort.\nEven when you account for a possible headwind, equipment differences, and stop-start tactics, a two-minute difference is nearly unfathomable. That is a 9% increase in speed between 2023 and 2025.\nVelon published portions of Pogačar’s data last year, including his 48km solo effort to win Il Lombardia. He averaged 340w for just over an hour last year, versus 390w for 50 minutes this year. It is an incredible difference.\nWhat we are seeing is not just the addition of heat training and shorter cranks. Instead, we are seeing the difference that these changes make when they are implemented long-term. That is the key: long-term improvement. You could add heat training to any cyclist’s program and they will probably gain a few watts in the first couple of weeks. But how many watts will they gain when they heat train consistently for 2.5 years? That’s what we are finding out now.\nYou can apply the same principles to your own training. Take the things that you know work for you. Let’s say it is weekly heat training, VO2 Max intervals, and core work. Don’t just commit to a few weeks of training – commit to a full year. You will make small gains in the first few weeks, but think of how much you can gain in the long term.\nRemember that your progress won’t be linear (i.e. you won’t gain 2w on your FTP every single week). It’s much more likely that your progress looks like a staircase. Some weeks you will improve, while others you might stagnate. But when you are consistent with your goals, the progress will always be there in the long-term. Just look at Pogačar’s 2025 season.\nHe won his fourth Tour de France, but he certainly wasn’t at his best, and he didn’t break any of the performance benchmarks that he set during the 2024 Tour. Pogačar won the Ronde van Vlaanderen and Liège-Bastogne-Liège, but he came up short at Milan-San Remo and Paris-Roubaix.\nEven at the UCI Road World Championships, Pogačar didn’t look his best when he failed to reach the podium in the time trial. But he didn’t let that performance keep him down. A few days later, he dominated the road race to earn his second consecutive rainbow jersey.\n\nPower Analysis data courtesy of Strava\nStrava sauce extension\nRiders:\n\nTadej Pogačar\nOscar Onley\nQuinn Simmons",

    "body_content": "The outdoors are tough on your hair: multiday backcountry hiking trips without a shower, sweaty bike and climbing helmets, loose strands freezing into icicles on the slopes. Even without these challenges, it’s normal to lose 50 to 100 hairs a day, but usually you don’t notice it because you’re simultaneously growing new hair. Until you’re not. The most common reason for hair loss is called androgenic alopecia—basically, genetics plus aging—and while it’s harmless, that doesn’t mean you have to like it.\nThe elements can be hard on your hair but treating hair loss doesn&#8217;t have to be. (Photo: Getty Images)\nIf having hair makes you feel more confident—more like “you”—you’re in luck. Preventing hair loss isn’t the undertaking you may be imagining. Sure, it used to consist of visits to the doctor, messy and time-consuming topical treatments, and the perceived stigma of seeking help in the first place. Enter Hims &amp; Hers.\nThe Hims &amp; Hers experience begins by using its intuitive online platform to enter information about your hair condition and goals. Next, medical professionals evaluate your condition and recommend a care plan. Within days, you’ll receive your treatment directly to your door, if prescribed. Some treatment plans are as simple as once-a-day chewables. Check them out below.\nHims Citrus Flavored Chew\nThe most common form of hair loss is androgenic alopecia. (Photo: Getty Images)\nThis chewable tablet—meant to be taken once per day—features a unique blend of finasteride and minoxidil, a combination clinically proven to stop hair loss in its tracks and kick-start regrowth. Finasteride first blocks the enzyme that converts testosterone into DHT, a hormone that can contribute to hair loss. The resulting reduced DHT levels help hinder hair loss.\nMinoxidil works in tandem with finasteride to further stimulate hair regrowth by increasing blood flow to hair follicles, promoting healthier hair at the source. Within three to six months of taking the chewable, the results will speak for themselves.*\nLearn More\nHers Green Apple Gummy  \nMinoxidil and biotin are key components in hair health. (Photo: Getty Images)\nLike the Hims Citrus-Flavored Chew, the Hers Green Apple Gummy is a simple, once-per-day treatment specifically formulated for women by expert dermatologists.\nThis gummy pairs minoxidil with biotin, which is key for hair health and a major factor in nail health. Low biotin levels can contribute to hair loss, but taking this daily gummy helps restore healthy levels—supporting stronger, fuller-looking hair and nails. (More biotin equals fewer broken nails for rock climbers.)\nWhether you’re sending it up a rock face or down a chute, the last thing you’re probably thinking about is your hair, but it’s nice having peace of mind that Hims &amp; Hers is working behind the scenes to make it stronger and healthier.\nLearn More\n\n*Individual results may vary.

Consider it a respite from your responsibilities so you can feel into yourself.\nYou’re going to rest in this calming pose for the entire duration of the 15-minute yoga class. You can take any approach you like to the pose, although following are some options for you to explore.\n15-Minute Yoga (That&#8217;s Entirely Child’s Pose Variations)\n\nYou’ll stay in each variation of Child’s Pose for a few minutes. No props are required although you can make yourself more comfortable with a folded blanket beneath your knees, some pillows beneath your hips, or whatever other props work for you.\nTake your time and consider this your chance to be still with whatever needs to be released or held or observed in a compassionate way.\n(Photo: Yoga With Kassandra)\nChild’s Pose Seed Variation\nBegin with your knees pretty close toward one another, your forehead resting on the mat, and your arms alongside your legs, palms facing upward. So take a few breaths here to get settled and comfortable. Feel your shoulders release as you come into this little cocoon. You’re going to stay here for a few minutes, exactly as you are.\nBring some awareness around your facial muscles and around your neck. Notice if any tension is creeping in. Simply observe it and see if you can release it. Know that whatever reaction or emotion that comes up is perfectly okay.

Keep your forehead on the mat, maybe propping your hands underneath your forehead for more comfort and support, or it might feel good to turn one ear to the ground.\nWhen you widen your knees, you might find that it&#8217;s easier for you to take some belly breaths, so when you inhale, you feel your belly expand, and when you exhale, it just naturally contracts back to its normal position.\nIf you had one ear on the mat, turn your head the other way after a couple minutes.\n(Photo: Yoga With Kassandra)\nChild’s Pose With a Side Stretch\nKeeping your knees wide, add a little side bend here by walking your hands as far over toward the right as you can and stretching through your left shoulder and side body. Relax your forehead down on the mat and try to melt your chest toward the mat.\nSee if you can find complete softness here with no pressure or expectations on yourself.\nLetting go of the idea of performance or results. Truly just feeling into whatever is present for you at this time and letting that be perfectly okay.\nThen walk your hands and your chest over to the left, crawling through your fingertips, and remaining here.\nYour Choice Child’s Pose\nSlowly come back into the version of Child’s Pose in which you started, with your knees close together, your arms reaching back, and your forehead to the ground.

The idea is simple: Ski Winter Park twice in November, and unlock season-long perks.\nGet five (5!) First Tracks tickets when you log two days at Winter Park in November. (Photo: Courtesy of Winter Park)\nThose who log two November ski days earn an early-access day to ski Mary Jane before it opens to the public, a membership to the exclusive Rope Drop Club—a ski patrol text list with real-time notifications for terrain openings—and five transferable Early Ups tickets for first tracks access.\nHere’s how it works: After you’ve skied your two days, Winter Park will send you an invite for early access to Mary Jane and a request to join the Rope Drop Club text list. For the latter, passholders will receive real-time alerts all season long, with the most coveted texts coming when terrain opens for the first time. Later in the season, those alerts might tip you off to rope drops after big storms and avy control work.\nWinter Park is getting the stoke going early this season. (Photo: Courtesy of Winter Park)\nSend&#8217;er November is just for Winter Park and Ikon passholders, but, Miller notes, &#8220;the Early Ups tickets are good to use for the passholder who earned them or they can share with friends. So someone could use all five for themselves or share them with four friends on a big powder day.”\nThe November fun doesn’t stop there. There are events the first three Saturdays in November—Nov. 8, 15, 22—starting with Winter Park’s opening day, Nov. 8. After the lifts start turning for the season, the mountain hosts a rail jam and poker run, where you ski the mountain to build your hand and compete for prizes. The next Saturday, Nov. 15, there’s an amateur ski ballet competition with costumes and prizes,; and on Nov. 22, Winter Park hosts a friendly mogul competition on Mary Jane.\nThe early-season celebrations are in honor of the 50th anniversary of Mary Jane joining Winter Park in 1975. (Photo: Courtesy of Winter Park)\nAll three Saturdays, Winter Park and Ikon passholders get access to the “Pass Holder Lounge” at The Lodge at Sunspot, where they can jam to live music and try samples of Winter Park’s new culinary offerings, get a complimentary ski or board wax, and enter to win custom skis and parking passes.\nAt the end of the day, all of this fun is in honor of Mary Jane’s 50th birthday. The mountain joined the existing Winter Park terrain in 1975 and has become a beloved part of the resort known for its bumps and tree skiing. So while it may be MJ&#8217;s big season, you get the presents. A happy anniversary, indeed.",

    "item_title": "Why Does Washington Have So Many Climbing Accidents? A Mountain Rescue Team Lead Offers Answers.",
    "item_subtitle": "A climber and 12-year technical rescue expert shares surprising insights into why his state has so many climbing accidents and fatalities.",
    "body_content": "What’s going on with Washington? The latest Accidents in North American Climbing reveals that the state is tied with Colorado for most climber fatalities in 2024. The state of Washington also had the third most reported accidents and the third most injuries in 2024 of any state or region in North America.\nBut 2024 is no anomaly. Since the American Alpine Club started tracking in 1951, Washington has had more reported accidents than any other state or region. Washington has 2,134 climber accidents recorded to date, followed by California, with 1,798 accidents. Washington also ties with California for most climber fatalities to date (378 per state).\nTo get some local insights, we reached out to Chelan County Mountain Rescue in north-central Washington. This volunteer specialized team responds to climbers’ calls from the peaks of the North Cascades and the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area, to the crags, boulder fields, and ice routes near Leavenworth via Steven’s Pass.\nVernon Nelson, Jr. has been volunteering with Chelan County Mountain Rescue for 12 years. His rescue group specializes in technical rock and alpine rescue calls. Over those dozen years, he’s responded to an estimated 150 calls. Born and raised in Washington, Nelson is an all-around climber himself with experience in rock, ice, and alpine.\nNelson rigging a tree anchor for a rescue  (Photo: Courtesy Vernon Nelson, Jr.)\n“It’s all volunteer,” Nelson says of his rescue team, which he says is true of most mountain rescue and SAR operations in the United States. “So it’s a lot of work for not a lot of pay and it’s not always the most enjoyable.” Sometimes, he literally has to take paid time off from his job as a high school social studies teacher to go on rescue calls.\nSo why do it? “I climb so it just seemed like a way to give back,” he explains. “I have that mentality—give back where you can.”\nThankfully, 2025 is shaping up to be a slow year for Chelan County Rescue, according to Nelson, who currently serves as a rescue team lead. But historically, Chelan County has been wildly accident-intensive. To figure out “the why” behind Washington’s accident statistics, Nelson spoke with his fellow rescuers and had some theories that could explain all the action in his state.\nWhy does Washington have so many climber accidents and fatalities?\n“I thought for sure California would be higher than us,” Nelson says of the historically—and currently—high accident, injury, and fatality numbers in his state. Here are three theories for why Washington is so accident-prone.\n1. The Cascades serve as an alpine training ground.\n“What we kept coming back to was the fact that the Cascades have traditionally been an alpine training ground for people,” Nelson explains. He says that climbers often believe that if they can climb in the Cascades, they’re ready for bigger objectives in Alaska, for example. “They’re cutting teeth here,” he says.\nBut if climbers lack the experience, the training objectives they embark on in Washington’s Cascade Mountains doesn&#8217;t always go as planned. “I love the Cascades. I don’t want to sound negative,” Nelson says. “But even though it’s a training ground, it’s not like a gym training ground.”\nNelson adds that even though Washington only has two 14ers, it’s not like Colorado, where you can drive up to 11,000 feet or even to 14,000 feet in the case of Pikes Peak. You might do a 9,000-foot peak in Washington, but you’re only driving up to 1,500 feet, for example. This means that many Washington climbers are experiencing the effects of altitude without being previously acclimatized—and are often in for a longer haul.\n2. Washington is rugged—and heavily glaciated\nWhile Nelson admits he hasn’t climbed much in the Sierras, he does have experience climbing in Colorado, Arizona, Montana, Wyoming, and other states. His takeaway? “The Cascades are pretty uniquely rugged.” He believes that this is in part due to the remaining glaciers in the state.\nIn fact, Washington has more glaciers clinging on than any other state in the Lower 48. According to the academic geology project “Glaciers of the American West,” 3,101 glaciers remain in Washington, covering a total area of nearly 174 square miles. California comes in second, with 1,788 glaciers. Wyoming still has 1,477 glaciers. However, California is ranked fourth in terms of total glacier coverage, with less than 18 square glaciated miles statewide.\nLake Colchuk still retains a glacier. The Enchantments can be seen beyond. (Photo: Dan Daley / Getty)\nWhile glacier travel presents hazards of its own, Washington alpinists may also encounter poor quality rock as terrain becomes unglaciated due to climate change. “The rock hasn’t had time to figure itself out,” Nelson posits. He points to melting glaciers, including Snow Creek Glacier on the backside of Dragontail Peak (8,842’), or Colchuk Glacier on the peak’s front side.\n“When I started climbing in the range 15 years ago, they weren’t as steep or technical,” Nelson recalls of the changing conditions. For example, in the early season, the Snow Creek Glacier is “a rampy walk-up,” but show up in the late season, and climbers will encounter a “dead vertical” ice wall.\nAnother aspect of Washington’s ruggedness? “The trails suck,” Nelson says. Oftentimes, for example, his approaches to ice climbs consist of no more than faint paths that could easily be mistaken for game trails. “It’s just tricky here,” he says.\n3. Big peaks are easily accessible from a major population center.\nNelson’s third theory for Washington’s many accidents comes down to convenience. “You can fly into Seattle and be in the Enchantments in a couple hours,” he explains. In Los Angeles, for example, climbers will encounter a longer drive—and no doubt, ample traffic, into the mountains. But it’s a relatively quick trip from Seattle to nearby crags and peaks.\nCompared to more rural states like Montana or Wyoming, Seattle is a large population center. Over 800,000 people live in Seattle, which has a major airport you can easily fly into. Furthermore, many of the calls Nelson runs involve visitors rather than locals, rather than residents. “By sheer numbers, most of our deaths are visiting climbers,” he says. While he didn’t have exact percentage breakdowns, he says that the majority are “definitely out of county and normally out of state.” He explains that the rough conditions also often “catch people by surprise.”\nNelson’s advice for climbing in Washington\nFor anyone coming from out of state to climb in Washington, Nelson recommends preparing for less than polished conditions. Expect rocky, rooted, muddy, overgrown, and faint trails. Prepare for weather that changes rapidly. In the winter, know the latest avalanche forecast and climb accordingly. And keep in mind that because Washington’s summits reach a relatively low elevation compared to those in California or Colorado, heat exhaustion presents a real risk in the summer, no matter how high you go.\nChelan County Mountain Rescue is a nonprofit volunteer organization based in Washington.

    "body_content": "On May 13, 2022, ground was broken on the first adaptive trail network in the world. Now, you can watch the inspiring story of how it all came to be.\nBest Day Ever follows the stories of adaptive mountain bikers Allie Bianchi, 26, and Greg Durso, 40, as they explore life after disability in a Green Mountains biking community.\nThe idea for the film was born the day Berne Broudy, president of Richmond Mountain Trails in Vermont, joined Greg and some of their friends for a ride. Berne recalls witnessing how difficult it was for Greg to ride fluidly like the rest of the crew. &#8220;This is so dumb,&#8221; she expresses in the film, watching him being carried across bridges too narrow for his bike. &#8220;There are so many problems in this world that aren’t solvable. We can solve this problem.”\nBest Day Ever will tear at your core. It will inspire you to never put limitations on yourself or on others.\n&#8220;It’s hard to understand, said Berne. &#8220;I think the inclination, as able-bodied people, is to feel bad for somebody who’s had an injury, but when somebody doesn’t feel bad for themselves, it changes your perspective.&#8221;\nThe film follows the completion of the Driving Range, now a fully adaptive network with intermediate to expert to pro-level trails, and Allie, on her first ride post-accident. Using an adaptive bike she received via a grant with help from Greg, who works as the senior director of programs at the Kelly Brush Foundation, Allie made the decision to revisit the trail feature where she injured her spine.\n&#8220;I was told I&#8217;d be in a power chair my whole life,&#8221; she says in the film. &#8220;I basically told them &#8216;fuck you.'&#8221;\nAllie&#8217;s first time on the trail post injury (Photo: Best Day Ever)\nCatch the premiere of Best Day Ever at Heartland Film Festival on October 17 in Indianapolis, Indiana, the first of ten festivals showcasing the film.\nThe Driving Range Opens to the Public\nAfter failed attempts to find a builder who could catch their vision, Berne and Greg linked up with trail builders like Tom Lepesqueur of L&amp;D Trailworks. &#8220;They said it wouldn&#8217;t be possible,&#8221; Berne told Outside, but Berne found folks willing to get to work. They took Greg out on the trails to help them identify problem areas and then to give the routes a final ride.\n&#8220;It changed the way we were thinking about trails from there on out,&#8221; Lepesqueur says in the film. &#8220;In hindsight, there are many trails I’ve built in my career that could&#8217;ve been better for adaptive riders with not a heck of a lot more effort.&#8221;\n\nBerne working on the trail crew (Photo: Best Day Ever)\nThe Driving Range took about three years to complete. Hundreds of volunteers helped get it open to the public by August 2023, and it remains free for all. Every Wednesday night, volunteers, able-bodied riders, and adaptive riders join to eat, drink, and ride. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to get people to leave,&#8221; Berne shared with Outside. &#8220;I hope people will continue to come and experience it and use it as a model for trails in their community.&#8221;\nWhen a trail is marked a black diamond, it&#8217;s actually black for all riders, able-bodied or disabled. &#8220;These trails are rocky, they’re hard, they’re challenging, and they&#8217;re fun to ride,&#8221; Rob Galloway, an adaptive mountain bike instructor says in the film.\nAnd once you meet adaptive mountain bikers like Greg and Allie, &#8220;you recognize that they are more aggressive, more skilled, more capable, more passionate,&#8221; Bec Wojtecki, director of Richmond Mountain Trails shared. &#8220;You  realize like &#8216;why do I have all these trails and they don’t?&#8217;”\nGreg leading an adaptive ride (Photo: Best Day Ever)\nGreg has also helped launch a series of camps with the Kelly Brush Foundation to welcome anyone with a spinal cord injury who’s interested in adaptive mountain biking.\n&#8220;I never would have thought adaptive mountain biking would be on my list,&#8221; Gretchen Dsouza, an adaptive rider who attended one of the camps, says in the film. “I’ve been in a chair for ten years, and I&#8217;m just now getting to do these things. It’s never too late.”\nAllie, who doesn&#8217;t have the function of her hands or upper body, gave Outside a glimpse into how her bike works. &#8220;I strap my hands basically onto the handlebars because I don&#8217;t have any grip. Then, on my right hand, I have a throttle pad that I use a wrist motion in my shoulder strength to kind of drop my elbow down and use that wrist. It allows the throttle to get the bike to go. With her left wrist, Allie pushes down on a bar that engages the brakes.\nAllie is just getting started, but Greg has been at it for years now. He&#8217;s participated in the past two U.S. Opens for downhill mountain biking, has crossed the Ironman finish line, and so much more. &#8220;I have all of these amazing dreams because of this community,&#8221; Greg told Outside.\nAn adaptive rider showing their spinal cord surgery scar (Photo: Best Day Ever)\nWhen we asked the crew about how the film got its name, Greg cut through the silence: &#8220;I say the day I got injured was probably the best day ever. It totally changed the trajectory of my life.&#8221;\n&#8220;It can be hard to know how to do something positive. Well, we invite people to get involved with this work,&#8221; Berne shared.\nBuy a ticket to watch the film, and help raise funds for adaptive athletes to get specialized equipment and trails.

    "item_title": "This Year’s Hottest Ultralight Upgrade Costs Just $13",
    "item_subtitle": "CNOC unveils the ThruBottle as a direct upgrade to the Smartwater bottle.",
    "body_content": "Ultralighters and thru-hikers love cheap gear, and nothing represents that ethos better than the Smartwater bottle. Its appeal is trifold: First of all, it is very cheap. Depending where you buy it, the one-liter version costs between $3 and $5. It’s very light at just over one ounce. And most importantly, it works flawlessly with water filters like the Sawyer Squeeze and Platypus Quickdraw—no adapters needed. It’s flexible enough to squeeze, but robust enough to last hundreds of miles on trail.\nCNOC, well known for its ultralight water bladders and soft-sided bottles, is the first brand to really take on the challenge of de-throning Smartwater as king of water carry for weight-conscious ultralighters and thru-hikers. The long-awaited ThruBottle shares the basic design that makes the Smartwater bottle so popular: Slim, tall, with a 1-liter capacity, and with a 28-millimeter thread compatibility for squeeze filters. It costs $13, or about the equivalent of four disposable bottles. So is it just a Smartwater clone, or a worthy upgrade? Let’s dig into the details.\nThe Cnoc ThruBottle side-by-side a Smartwater bottle (Photo: Nathan Pipenberg)\nWeight\nFor ultralight hikers, this is the first concern. Carrying a ThruBottle instead of a Smartwater bottle will come with a two-ounce weight penalty: A one-liter Smartwater is about 1.2 ounces and our sample of the ThruBottle weighs 3 ounces. For some hikers, that weight difference is likely enough to write-off the ThruBottle.\nDurability\nThat weight difference comes entirely down to the type and thickness of plastic used in each bottle. The ThruBottle, made with thicker HDPE plastic, is certainly more durable than the PET plastic in the Smartwater bottle, and doesn’t bend and crinkle over time the way a Smartwater bottle does after repeated squeezing during a long hike. After a month of use, the ThruBottle essentially looks brand new, while the Smartwater bottle is covered in creases and dents.\nAfter enough abuse, a Smartwater bottle can become so misshapen it breaks, leaks water, and no longer stands up on end.\nThe Cnoc ThruBottle is easy accesses from side pockets thanks to a nylon top loop (Photo: Nathan Pipenberg)\nUsability\nThe ThruBottle’s thicker plastic also means that squeezing the bottle to filter water requires a bit more strength. We had no problem filtering water with the ThruBottle using one hand, but it is noticeably stiffer than a Smartwater bottle. Using a brand new filter, it took us about one minute to filter a liter of water in a Smartwater bottle, and about 20 seconds longer using a ThruBottle. Since the ThruBottle doesn’t deform quite as readily, you do need to unscrew the filter more often to “reset” the bottle by letting air back inside. Long term, these are minor quibbles. After repeated uses, filters tend to slow down anyway, and the flow rate is usually dictated by the filter, not the vessel. In day-to-day use, the ThruBottle is just fine.\nOtherwise, there’s not much to discuss—it’s a basic water bottle. It has a nearly identical shape to a Smartwater bottle, with a slim profile and straight sides that make it easy to pull out of a side pocket and stow it away again. Like a Nalgene, it has markers that show the volume of water inside. The cap has a tether, which can be removed if you want to replace the cap with a filter. There’s also a small loop of cord to hang the bottle or help you pull it from a pocket.\nSingle Use vs. Reusable \nLongevity is a big part of CNOC’s sales pitch: Unlike a Smartwater bottle, this is a vessel that’s meant to be reused. Hikers do reuse Smartwater bottles, sometimes for months, but ultimately they end up in the recycling bin or landfill. Given the durability of the ThruBottle, there’s no reason why it couldn’t last you for years.\nAside from longevity, there is some evidence that the plastic used in the ThruBottle is safer for long-term use than the plastic used in Smartwater bottles. Coca-Cola, which owns the Smartwater brand, says the bottles are made with food-grade PET plastic and are BPA-free. In contrast, the ThruBottle is made with HDPE plastic, which CNOC says is BPA-, BPS-, and BPF-free.\nResearch has shown that there are other plasticizers and compounds, like phthalates, used to make plastic bottles that can leach into water and have health impacts on humans. Some studies suggest that these compounds are more likely to leach into water when exposed to high temperatures, and that PET is more susceptible to this than HDPE. In other words, there are fewer health concerns with washing a ThruBottle in hot water, or drinking water from it after it’s been baking in the sun compared to a Smartwater bottle. Other studies found that in normal temperatures, both PET and HDPE are chemically stable. And at least one suggests that HDPE leaches more chemicals than PET.\nBoth plastics are recyclable, though most plastics—even those that end up in recycling bins—don’t get recycled. In terms of microplastics, studies have shown that both HDPE and PET can shed microplastics. There is some evidence that damaged bottles shed more microplastics than new ones—a point against re-using Smartwater bottles.\nWithout better research to turn to, our conclusions here are pretty simple. One, using a more durable ThruBottle will have less impact on the planet than replacing Smartwater bottles regularly. Two, using the ThruBottle might be slightly better for your personal health, but the research is far from conclusive. If microplastics and chemical migration are a real concern for you, don’t use a plastic bottle.\nThe Cnoc ThruBottle has handy measurements along the side  (Photo: Nathan Pipenberg)\nWho is the ThruBottle For?\nThe ThruBottle is a product designed expressly for backpackers looking for a lightweight bottle that attaches to squeeze water filters. If you use a different type of filter, like a pump, the ThruBottle will still work fine, but there’s no inherent reason to use it. Thru-hikers and ultralighters are the target audience, because combining a Sawyer Squeeze and a lightweight bottle with 28mm threads creates one of the lightest and most reliable ways to filter water. The ThruBottle isn’t quite as light as a Smartwater bottle, but if you want to reduce waste, buy less, or simply like the idea of a bottle that will last years rather than weeks, the two-ounce weight penalty shouldn’t keep you away.",

    "item_subtitle": "Imperfections are the greatest teachers.",
    "body_content": "Sprawling out in Savasana can feel as close to perfect as you can get. As a result, you might attempt to curate a perfect experience. Maybe you arrange your arms and legs so they’re *precisely* equidistant from your body or cover yourself with a blanket, pull it taut, and smoothen it of any wrinkles—and only then can you allow yourself to relax.\nBut sometimes, it&#8217;s these moments of striving for perfection that make us a little too “Princess and the Pea” about Savasana. Especially if you let tiny details—a forgotten hair-tie wrapped around your wrist or one foot turned out more than the other—be enough to derail your end-of-class surrender.\nWhen you think about it, wouldn’t it have been better if the princess got used to the pea? Learning to accept imperfection could’ve taught her how to be calm when things didn’t go as planned. (Not to mention she’d have been an easier houseguest.)\nThe same principle applies to an “imperfect” Savasana. Perhaps by overindulging our fussiness, we deprive ourselves of an opportunity to get comfortable being just a little less comfortable. Practicing an uneven or asymmetrical Savasana can help with that.\n\nHow to Practice Asymmetrical Savasana\nInstead of coming into Savasana as you normally do, identify one (or more) deviations you can take on one side of the body. When you feel that both sides of your body don’t “match,” it can be a welcome chance for any of us with perfectionist impulses to practice accepting annoyance.\nWith regular practice of asymmetrical Savasana, you might find yourself making peace with other unpredictable disturbances during yoga (the snoring of the person lying next to you in class or the beeping of a truck outside.) It might also teach you to cultivate tolerance during off-the-mat obstacles (at work speaking to a difficult client or in a long line at the grocery store). The list is endless as to what “imperfections” in life you could accept exactly as they are.\n\nLie on your back as you would for Savasana. Then, choose your own adventure: move one foot a few inches toward the side. Place a folded blanket, bolster, or block underneath one calf. Draw one hand to the side so it’s in line with your shoulder. Place a blanket or bolster underneath one hand.\nNotice how it feels when your chosen body part is out of place. Acknowledge any temptation to correct it. Register any sensations in your body or mind that are different than usual. Ask yourself, “Am I okay where I am?” Draw your attention to the breath. Recognize that you’re feeling “off” and practice letting it go. Even if you want to change your current position, practice inwardly saying “yes” to the position you’re in, and relaxing even more.\nThere may be other thoughts or emotions that disturb your peace. Or your mind may be as placid as a pond—except for the disturbance (also known as the ancient principle of vrrti) of your imperfect position. Instead of trying to banish that disturbance, see if you can lessen your resistance to it.\nAfter a few minutes, start to move your fingers and toes and roll onto one side. Slowly come to a seated position. See if you can carry the same sense of patience you practiced in your asymmetrical Savasana into another part of your day.",

My classes are consistently full, and I know my students leave feeling stronger, challenged, and centered.

I was “too sweet.” My energy wasn’t &#8220;high enough.&#8221; They suggested my voice was better suited for gentler classes.\nAnd here’s the thing: I do teach those formats. I love holding space for restorative practices. But I also love to move. I love to feel strong. Being told otherwise made me question myself.\nDuring the evaluation, I stumbled on my words under the gaze of a lead teacher, who held a stopwatch and kept her eyes fixed on me the entire time. I knew it wasn’t my best class. But still, the words cut deep.\nFor me, this experience immediately activated my imposter syndrome. Even as an experienced teacher, I left that yoga teaching evaluation questioning myself. And I know I’m not alone. I&#8217;ve spoked to many teachers  who admit to feeling the same: pressured to perform, measured by numbers, and asked to fit into a mold that leaves little space for individuality or authenticity.\nThe irony is that I know I’m a strong teacher physically, mentally, and energetically. I’ve watched students leave class stronger, sweatier, and more grounded.\nSo yes, that experience shook my confidence. But only for a moment.

    "item_subtitle": "Meet Carl Cocchiarella, Colorado’s least-successful elk hunter. After four decades of near misses, he’s learned that killing an animal isn’t the best part of a hunt.",
    "body_content": "When I located Carl Cocchiarella on a hillside at 10,500 feet, after hiking for hours toward a blue dot on my phone, he was eating lunch in the shade of a large spruce, blended with the terrain like the savvy hunter he is. His $2,000 compound bow rested in the dirt. He chomped into a flour tortilla slathered in peanut butter while reclined next to his hunting partner, Teig Olson.\nI would give you a rough idea of where we were, except Carl insisted I refer to the location only as “the high country of Colorado.” He explained why: “Hunters are territorial, and they have guns.” So did he: a Glock strapped to his hip, in case a large predator tried to move in on his kill. The prospect of him killing something, however, constituted a mighty if, considering this was Carl’s 40th year as an archery hunter and he had never harvested an animal with an arrow.\nIt was early September 2024, the second day of Colorado’s bow season. Carl, a 65-year-old house painter from Vail, held elk and deer tags good for both sexes but so far had not seen any animals. The sun’s heat felt like it does in July. Carl had dark, greasy smudges on his cheeks to avoid detection by his targets, and was dressed in a camouflage long-sleeve hoodie and beige pants. He would have been nearly impossible to spot if not for his 75-liter azure backpack, which could only be camouflaged in an ocean.\nCarl started hunting, with a rifle, in 1983, drawn by the idea of filling his freezer with meat. He harvested a large buck his first day out, downvalley from Vail. Then he got a bow and never went back to bullets. He still owns a very nice rifle and knows it would improve his chances. But harvesting on its own is no longer worth the concessions in style and pride—and hasn’t been for decades.\nTeig, a local electrician 24 years younger than Carl, has no problem making such concessions, even if his heart, like Carl’s, belongs to his bow. Resting in the shade, Teig was camouflaged from his ballcap—a brown flat-brim that read “Elk Hunter”—to his boots, all 6 feet and 3 inches of him. He spoke only in whispers.\nSometimes Carl and Teig hunt with other people, but mostly they go with each other. Their relationship skews toward mentor-mentee—Carl the self-deprecating sage, Teig the highly skilled understudy—owing to Carl’s experience in the mountains more than their respective hunting records. Quietly through the years, Carl had built an impressive list of conquests: he skied the Messner Couloir on Denali, riding out three nights in an ice cave at 17,000 feet; climbed the east ridge of Mount Logan, North America’s second tallest point, during a blizzard; made a first descent in Patagonia; summited three peaks in a season in Peru’s Cordillera Blanca; and kayaked the Grand Canyon.\nHe also survived a full avalanche burial on Vail Pass before transceivers were widely used; a thunderous slab in British Columbia that nearly washed him over a cliff—saved by a sapling that he grabbed at the last second; and a crevasse fall on Mont Blanc that left him dangling above death.\n“Carl gets a lot of good days because he’s not afraid of the bad days,” says Scott Toepfer, a retired avalanche forecaster and one of his closest friends, summing up Carl’s approach to adventure.\nTeig, meanwhile, grew up in the Vail Valley and started hunting as a grommet, following his dad through the forest with a rubber-band gun. He killed his first elk with a rifle when he was 12. As soon as he tried bow hunting, he says, “I caught the fever.” He found its intimacy—most shots are taken within 40 yards—“addicting. You only get one chance.”\nOver 16 seasons as an archery hunter heading into 2024, Teig had harvested four elk, including a 600-pound bull that fed his family for two years. That success rate was about two and a half times the 2023 average, which hovers around ten percent in Colorado and serves as one of the discipline’s chief deterrents. Teig’s father never got into bow hunting. “He’d say, ‘No, I’m not a vegetarian,’” Teig recalls.\nI had backcountry skied with Carl for years and often heard stories about his hunts, tinged with hints of hilarity. I also knew he avoided attention; allowing a reporter into his fold went against his ideology. He agreed to let me chronicle his season reluctantly.\nMore than simply accompanying him through the forest, I was here to see how Carl, a proud outdoorsman, self-made and successful, had lasted four decades in a sport built on results. How did he maintain his passion in the face of so much failure? And what life lessons might be buried within his futility?\nJust downhill from their lunch spot, Carl and Teig made a plan in hushed tones that would take them back to camp by sunset. “I’m gonna go slow,” Carl said. “I might sit down.” “That’s fine, Carl,” Teig replied. Carl smiled. They fist bumped and tiptoed in opposite directions.",

    "item_title": "Yell This, Not That: The Science of Cheering That Works",
    "item_subtitle": "Scientists explore the optimal mix of instructional, motivational, and personalized cheerleading",
    "body_content": "My wife is running a marathon this weekend, so I’m prepping for my vital role as cheerleader. This will involve suppressing my tendency to yell sarcastic things like “Hang in there, only 23 miles to go!” early in the race. Instead, I’d ideally like to say exactly the right things at the right times to spur her to a better performance—which is why a study in this month’s issue of the International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance caught my attention.\nLed by Sascha Ketelhut of the Institute of Sports Science in Switzerland, the study reviews the scientific literature on various ways of encouraging people to dig deeper during endurance activities: cheering, music and other noise, motivational self-talk, competition with others, and so on. The general gist is that these things all work, but the effects are variable, personal, and context-specific. One person’s psych-up song is another’s annoying earworm.\nThe Optimal Cheering Protocol\nDespite the variability, there’s robust evidence that—on average, at least—cheering really does help most people push harder. One of the key cheering studies was published last year by a group led by Dutch scientist Bas Van Hooren, a 1:02:04 half-marathoner who knows a few things about pushing hard. They found that subjects scored 4.1 percent higher on a VO2 max test when they were cheered on than when they completed the test in silence.\nThe basic idea, Ketelhut and his colleagues explain, is to divert the runner’s attention from the physical discomfort they’re experiencing. It’s the equivalent of pinching yourself when you stub your toe: your brain can’t take in everything at once, so focusing on what someone is yelling at you displaces some of the negative thoughts that might otherwise tempt you to slow down. Of course, some cheering has more complex effects, which we’ll get into below.\nThe cheering protocol Van Hooren used was carefully designed based on previous cheering research. They started out cheering every 60 seconds, increased to every 20 seconds as the runners got more fatigued, and then began cheering continuously, accompanied by clapping, when the runners were in the final stages of fatigue. They also gradually ramped up the volume from 50 to 70 decibels, and used a collection of phrases—“Way to go!,” “Good job!,” “Push it!”—that had been rated helpful in previous studies.\nThis is a good protocol to use when you’re in a lab cheering on someone who’s doing a VO2 max test on a treadmill. It’s not so good on the sidelines of a marathon, where you don’t have the option of cheering every 20 seconds (and would presumably drive the runners nuts if you cycled alongside them yelling for the whole race).\nCheering in Real Life\nIn 2022, sports psychologists Sophie Gibbs-Nicholls, Alister McCormick, and Melissa Coyle published a paper in (appropriately enough) The Sports Psychologist describing their work with “psyching teams” at Plymouth Marjon University in Britain. These teams of sports psychology faculty and students offered public workshops leading up to 10K and half-marathon races, and then showed up at the races to cheer on the participants in an evidence-based manner.\n\nThe researchers then interviewed runners to understand what types of cheering had seemed helpful or unhelpful. The most helpful cheering tended to be either instructional (how far to the finish, reminders about good running form) or motivational (praise, encouragement). Unhelpful cheering included misleading information about the course and remaining distance, criticism, and exhortations to dig deep when the runner already felt they were digging as deep as possible.\nGibbs-Nicholls and her colleagues synthesized their insights into a handy acronym—“IMPACT”—that’s worth unpacking. Here’s their advice for how to cheer:\nInstructional\nProvide useful information about the course or competition. How far until the next water stop? How far ahead or behind is your rival?\nMotivational\nOffer praise for their participation or effort. It can be as simple as “Great effort!”\nPersonalized\nMake eye contact, and if possible, use names or other personal info like a team name on a singlet. This creates a two-way relationship: “It’s almost kind of like a social obligation to carry on,” one of the runners reported.\nAuthentic\nSay things that you really mean. People can tell if you’re lying (“You can catch that guy who’s way up there in the distance, almost out of sight!”) or mouthing empty platitudes.\nConfidence-Building\nTry to build their “self-efficacy,” which is psych jargon for belief in their own ability to complete tasks or achieve goals. Reiterate how well they’re already doing, and express your belief that they can keep pushing. This self-belief is the master-switch that determines whether they will speed up, maintain pace, or slow down.\nTailored to the Distance\nOK, I think they mainly needed this one to ensure that the acronym spells a word, but the point is to give accurate (“Less than two miles to go!”) rather than generic (“You’re almost there!”) information.\n\nThere are other subtleties to consider. Experienced runners, for example, seem to get a smaller boost than novices, and probably benefit from more detailed and technical feedback. There are also psychological differences, with some research suggesting that hard-driving type A personalities don’t benefit as much from cheering. And in most studies, there’s a small subset of subjects who either don’t benefit or even perform worse, perhaps because they find the cheering distracting or annoying. But overall, the IMPACT framework seems like a good starting point—and hopefully it will keep me out of the doghouse this weekend.\n\nFor more Sweat Science, join me on Threads and Facebook, sign up for the email newsletter, and check out my new book The Explorer’s Gene: Why We Seek Big Challenges, New Flavors, and the Blank Spots on the Map.",

    "body_content": "Newton’s third law of physics states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Metaphorically speaking, I’ve found that this law also applies to skiing. I’ve had powder days of such immense joy that life feels infinite. “Live Forever” is still my favorite Oasis song.\nBut then comes the reaction. I’ve seen it take many forms in ski towns, including the loss of early compounding interest retirement savings, a lack of professional work experience, and failure to find a long-term partner, to name a few. However, for me, it took the form of chronic pain.\nDay in and day out, my left elbow has hurt from a fracture and dislocation injury eight years ago. My hips felt sore during rhythmic movements, such as pedaling a bike or ski touring. But most of all, my lower back pain, which ranged from a dull aching stiffness to pain so acute that I couldn’t move from bed. And I’m only 33 years old!\nWell, that is, until a year ago. That’s because I finally incorporated weight training into my daily rhythm. For the first time in ten years, I can say that there are entire days when I feel no pain, as if I were 18 years old.\nDo I still have aches and pains? Absolutely. My elbow is never going to be perfect (after a fracture and dislocation injury, it’s passable at best). Sitting still aggravates my back. And my knees and hips still crackle and pop when I get up in the morning. Nevertheless, weight training is the closest thing to a miracle cure that I’ve ever experienced.\nAs a disclaimer, I’m not a qualified trainer, and I’m not here to tell you exactly what movements to do and how to do them. That will depend on your personal situation, and I highly recommend working with a trainer. However, I will share my story and how weight training has helped me get to a much better place.\nThe author demonstrates the benefits of weight training for skiers. (Photo: Courtesy of Anna Lochhead-Sperling)\nHow Did I Get Here?\nI’m fortunate enough to have 1,000 days of skiing under my belt. One of the prices I’ve paid for that is 3,650 days of back pain. Yup, that’s at least 10 years of daily lower back aches—in addition to other ailments.\nOver the last decade, I tried everything to shake those aches. I would do yoga, stretch, and foam roll regularly. I took rest days and went on long, gentle walks. I slept on a firm mattress. I tried standing with my feet farther apart. I became a vegetarian and tried getting lean. I did sit-ups, planks, bicycles, and whatever else to try to strengthen my core. I sought out hot tubs and massages. That’s all good for management, but it doesn’t address the fundamental issue at hand: muscle imbalances.\nRelated: How to Avoid Tearing Your ACL, According to a U.S. Ski Team Surgeon\nSo, I spoke to an expert to figure out how to fix these imbalances, or at least outsmart them. Franco Morris, Head of Program Delivery at a local gym in Sydney, Australia, identifies muscle imbalances as the leading cause of the achiness that skiers experience. “It’s genetics,” says Franco. “We’re not evolved for what we do, whether that’s skiing, skateboarding, or, as is more often the case, sitting.”\nIf the average person is not evolved for skiing, I am especially unevolved for it. My 6&#8217;3 frame is supported by a 31-inch waist, which correlates to relatively small hips. My shoulders are unusually broad. And I’m not naturally flexible.\nThat whole upper-body apparatus is constantly swinging around while I ski. Meanwhile, the lower back does the dirty work of holding it all together without the help of its gluteal sidekick.\nWe can get away with it when we’re young, but Father Time ultimately lays down the law. “Our muscles become less malleable and responsive as we get older, making them more susceptible to tears and other injuries,” says Franco.\nIn my case, I lasted until I was 32. That’s when my back finally gave out. I had what’s known as a lower back spasm, which is when your muscles become so fatigued that they contract, aka “spasm,” to prevent further injury.\nIt was the most painful thing I’ve ever experienced, including my dislocated, broken elbow and subsequent surgery and rehabilitation. I couldn’t get out of bed. I missed work. I crawled to the toilet. Simply sneezing would put enough tension on my back to cause me to scream in agony. This, for an entire week. Twice.\nSo, in the end, it wasn’t even a question of improving my skiing, but whether I could continue skiing at all. Something had to be done.\nMy girlfriend, also a skier, deserves the credit for getting me into a weight training regimen. She had embarked on her journey a few months prior and was singing its praise. I’m now over a year out from my first class and feeling better than I have in a decade.\nIt hasn’t been easy; in fact, it has been extraordinarily challenging. There are days when it’s hard to sit on the toilet. Yet, I’ll always trade that type of fleeting soreness for chronic pain.\nThat whole upper-body apparatus is constantly swinging around while I ski. Meanwhile, the lower back does the dirty work of holding it all together without the help of its gluteal sidekick.  (Photo: Courtesy of Ella Lochhead-Sperling)\nMy Advice for Skiers Starting Weight Training\nOther than occasional fooling around in the weight room in college, I’ve started from nothing. Here’s what I’ve learned over the past year and how I apply it to my skiing.\nAll the movements I mention are also demonstrated in the video.\n1. Work With a Trainer\nTo lift properly is even more important than lifting. That’s why I recommend working with a highly qualified personal trainer. Group workouts are the only way most of us can afford to work with a trainer without breaking the bank. You’d be surprised at how affordable these programs can be (I pay about 45 USD per week).\nMore: Ski Harder And Stronger With These 5 Editor-Tested Electrolyte Drinks\nThe best trainers don’t just demonstrate movements; they inspire. Take Franco, who has become something akin to the spiritual leader of his gym community. Lifting weights, like skiing, is beautiful to watch when done well.\nTrainers also design balanced workouts that target a variety of muscles. At my gym, hour-long sessions are broken down into dozens of different exercises. Theoretically, you could use the internet or a book to design your own program, but for me, it’s worth it to pay the premium.\n2. Focus on the Posterior Chain\nTechnically, the posterior chain refers to the group of muscles along the backside of the body that drive posture and power. It includes the hamstrings, glutes, lower back, and even the calves and upper back.\nA few years ago, I began focusing on writing as a career, and my work life became confined to a desk. At first, I enjoyed the break from movement, and it allowed me to push harder when I did hit the slopes. However, after a span of years, the excessive sitting weakened my posterior chain to the point where I could no longer ski the way I once did without injury. Therefore, it’s my biggest focus.\nPosterior Chain Essential Movements\nHands down, the best workout for me has been the deadlift, where you lift a barbell from the ground to hip level with a straight back. It’s a direct engagement of the entire posterior chain.\nGoing for my 1 RM deadlift.  (Photo: Photo courtesy of Anna Lochhead-Sperlin)\nFor pure glute engagement, try a kettlebell swing. The movement requires a hinge at the hips to swing a kettlebell from between your legs up to chest height, using explosive power from the glutes rather than lifting with the arms.\nBarbell hip thrusts involve placing a barbell over your hips and driving them upwards. Your back can be on a bench or on the floor. I prefer the floor; it’s one less thing to set up.\nLastly, barbell step-ups involve setting a barbell across your back, as in a back squat, and stepping with one foot onto a box or bench. Then, drive through that leg to lift your body and step back down under control.\n3. Control is Everything\nWhen it comes to movement, low and slow is preferable to high and fast. It’s a lot harder to move under control, but this is where gains are made.\n4. Avoid the “Glamour” Muscles\n“Glamour” muscles refer to abs, biceps, and chest. While any balanced workout regimen will include these groups, you want to avoid gaining excessive mass in these areas.\nIt might look good, but having all that weight on your upper body isn’t going to do any favors for your skiing, or any other mountain sports, for that matter.\n5. Start Small\nOne of the challenges of group workouts is seeing just how weak you are compared to others.\nYou might feel compelled to compete, but it’s important to stay light. The first few weeks of weight training—especially if you’re in your thirties or older—are going to be brutal. There’s no way around it. The metamorphosis has begun, and it’s not a comfortable process. But the last thing you want to do is get injured and sacrifice your ski season.\nTake it easy for a few months. Like skiing, weight training is a years-long journey.\n6. Focus On Volume Over Weight\nAs skiers, we generally want to focus on repetitions rather than max weight. That’s because we are endurance athletes, not bodybuilders. In most cases, we don’t want to add too much muscle mass, as it weighs us down in the mountains.\nWe won’t gain as much size, but repetitions—say 10 reps at 60% of max weight rather than 3 reps at 85%—will build endurance, reduce the chance of injury, and still correct underlying weaknesses.\n7. Weigh the Pros and Cons\nWhich workout you choose to focus on is dependent on your specific situation. Sometimes there are conflicting benefits.\nFor example, squats are probably the most cliché way to hit the gym as a skier. And not only are they fantastic for my quads and glutes, but they’ve also worked my hip and knee joints, where I’ve been feeling almost zero inflammation. The flip side of this is that, especially with back squats, the weight on my upper body aggravates my lower back.\nMid squat, thinking about skiing.  (Photo: Photo courtesy of Anna Lochhead-Sperlin)\n8. Don’t Give Up\nYou’ll probably want to give up. I still think about it often. Weight training isn’t nearly as fun as skiing. Much the opposite; it’s frequently torturous.\nBut having the mental fortitude to stick it out through the hard minutes at the end of a class will add decades to your skiing longevity. Just think about that while you&#8217;re sweating in agony trying to work through your reps.\nWhile I’ve inherited a finicky back, I can’t help but feel lucky to have improved this much. A fracture would be worse. In fact, when I ask Franco why weight training helps skiers so much, the first thing he pointed out is prevention: “Building muscle promotes bone density, as well as adding cushioning tissue around bones.”\nI’m only a year into my weight training journey and am working with weights that, at best, would be considered novice. There’s just that much more room to improve. “The sky’s the limit,” says Franco, as we part ways from our interview, “most people have so much room for improvement that they can counter the effects of aging for a long time.”\nNot a bad prognosis.\nAs we like to say, (bluebird) sky is the limit. (Photo: Courtesy of Ella Lochhead-Sperling)",

Well, unless you delve into the discussions online complaining, “it&#8217;s not gravel,” but we will save that for another video, I promise.\nThere we some great custom bikes on display. This Enve Mog was certainly top of the pile in going all out.\nThis video is about all the tech, or at least as much tech as I can cram into one reasonably long video. And there was plenty this year.\nTom Pidcock&#8217;s Pinarello\nOne man who took much of the limelight before the rollout was, understandably, Mr. Tom Podcock. Having only wrapped up a sixth place at the previous day&#8217;s Lombardia monument, Pidcock took to the start line on a Pinarello Dogma F GR — a bike he claimed he hadn&#8217;t thrown a leg over before the morning of the race, at least not this exact race bike.\nPidcock is in a unique position when compared to every other rider who straddles multiple disciplines in that he is contractually obliged to use Scott bikes when on the road, just like the rest of his Q36.5 team. But once the dirt appears, Pidcock is obliged to use Pinarello. How? Why? Well, the gentleman who owns the clothing brand Q36.5, which is the title sponsor of Pidcocks&#8217; trade team, also owns Pinarello. I think they call it a vested interest.\nPidcock had two Pinarello Dogma F GR bikes at his disposal. One a british racing green and the other a toffee apple red. \nPidcock had two identically built Dogna F GRs on hand, both of which were custom-painted. Groupset came from SRAM, as was the Red AXS XPLR. Up front, Pidcock was running a 50-tooth chain ring, held in place by a Wolf Tooth guide. As a side note, from the sheer amount of Woolftooth on display at the race over the weekend, it would seem they have the gravel market well and truly sewn up.\nPidcock, along with several Vittoria-sponsored riders, was racing on the Terreno T10 Pro edition tires in what would seem to be a limited edition color. I still can&#8217;t make up my mind if they&#8217;re ace or a bit naff. \nPidcock was rolling on the pro edition of the Vittoria Terreno T10 tyres in the &#8220;wish-us-mere-morals-clould-get-them&#8221; caramel color.\nThe Saturday before the race, I managed to bump into the eventual winner, Florian Vermeersch, while he was standing in line, waiting patiently to pick up his registration packs. This may have been his third attempt at the gravel worlds, but he certainly either seemed a little nonchalant about his set-up or wasn&#8217;t quite up to speed on his build. What he didn&#8217;t deep-dive into on his bike didn&#8217;t matter, as he certainly put on a great showing to take home the world stripes.\nPretty much every Specialized sponsored rider used the Crux. \nAway from the two main big-hitter bikes in this video, there is everything from the usual pros rolling out on pistine race bikes with all the latest drool-worthy kit, to oddities like the Flanders pro rider taking on the race on a prototype titanium Eddy Merckx, which I have to say was damn handsome. It must also have been the only metal bike in the entire elite category; carbon was everywhere. But it wasn&#8217;t the only metal bike racing around Limburg. Nope, there were plenty on hand, and many from smaller players, handbuilt beauties and color schemes that would put the old masters to shame. They&#8217;re in the video. So hit that play button to see what delights were on show, getting dirty and in one case, crashing hard after 800m!\nUCI Gravel Worlds Tech Gallery\nSRAM dominates the gravel scene, but there was more than a smattering of Shimano, and more than a few riders using the new wireless XT rear mech.\nWolf Tooth was everywhere with its chainrings and chain catchers being outrageously popular.\nyep, and they even had a few headsets on show.\nA titanium Eddy Merckx. Lovely, just lovely. \nRomain bardet lined up (but didn&#8217;t finish) and is still sponsored by Lapierre, the bike manufacture he finished his road career on earlier this year.\n3D printed steel bottle cages, anyone?\nYe,s this isn&#8217;t a gravel bike, but I couldn&#8217;t not include it. The gentleman who had this was out watching the race, but his bike is all handmade, a Columbus steel front end matched to a 3D printed steel rear end. The cockpit is also 3D printed steel.\nThere was a bit of steel floating about in the peloton, including this beauty from curve. There&#8217;s a sad story behind this that you can find out more about if you hit that play button.\nYep, nose strips have made their way in to gravel racing.\nI&#8217;m going out on a limb here and saying there is no chance the rider who wrapped this will be getting that off in any hurry.\nPidcock&#8217;s race bike. He eventually finished sixth on the day. The same result as what he took at Lombardia  the day before.\nIt&#8217;s amazing what a little decal can do for jazzing up a wheelset. \nGotta know when to fuel.\nPlugs at the ready!",

    "item_subtitle": "Six reasons to explore the small town of Tusayan—from hiking in Kaibab National Forest to flying over the Grand Canyon.",
    "body_content": "The town of Tusayan (pronounced Too-Say-An) is like the welcome committee for the Grand Canyon as the closest incorporated town to the South Rim; it is the last stop before you see the earth’s great chasm. Amenities include fast food to fine dining, five hotels, a chocolate factory, and several tour operators. Here are six ways to explore while you’re in town.\n1. Wander the Woods\nExplore the ponderosa pine forest near Tusayan, Arizona (Photo courtesy Town of Tusayan)\nThe largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest in the world surrounds the whole town, offering ample opportunities for wandering. Opened in spring 2025, the Tusayan Forest Trails has two loops that take you through the forest and a sliver of the Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni &#8211; Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument, only recently designated in 2023. The shorter of the two trails is the 4.4-mile Tusayan Loop. The longer option is the 7.3-mile Montane Loop. Both trails are considered moderately difficult, with rocky terrain at 6,800 feet of elevation. Find the trailheads from the southern roundabout in Tusayan or from the Tusayan-Montane Campground.\nTusayan is also a dedicated Arizona Trail Gateway community. The section that passes through Tusayan, beginning from the Grandview Lookout Tower, is considered Passage 37 out of 43 total sections. The trail stretches for around 800 miles from Mexico to Utah, and is considered one of the more difficult thru-hikes for its unreliable water availability and rugged desert train.\n2. Go Camping\nJust four miles from the southern entrance to Grand Canyon National Park, Tusayan-Montane Campground is situated in a peaceful ponderosa pine and gambel oak forest on the Colorado Plateau. With 142 standard nonelectric campsites spread across five different loops, and 18 double campsites for groups up to 14 people, there’s plenty of room to set up basecamp for your stay. Its proximity to the park means campsites are generally reserved six months in advance on Recreation.gov. But 30 sites are available on a first-come, first-serve basis for spontaneous travelers.\n3. Take an Air Tour\nFly over the Grand Canyon with Maverick Helicopters ( Photo courtesy Maverick Helicopters)\nTusayan is home to the Grand Canyon National Park Airport, where numerous tour companies—Grand Canyon Airlines, Maverick Airstar, and Papillon Airways—run helicopter and airplane sightseeing flights over the enormous hole in the earth. Buckle up and get an aerial view of the Colorado River, South and North rims, and possibly even Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam. You’ll see more in a few hours than you can reach in a full week.\n4. Bike to the Park\nBike to the park from Tusayan (Photo courtesy Town of Tusayan)\nRight from town, hop on two wheels and pedal north on the Tusayan Greenway Trail, which is 70% gravel and 30% paved. It’s 6.6 miles one way to Mather Point on the South Rim, and you can either lock up your bike and roam the Historic Village or continue riding in the park. To get back to Tusayan, bike back the way you came, or board the free Purple Route shuttle which has bike racks. Don’t forget to purchase a national park pass—$20 per bicycle—at the Grand Canyon Visitor Center &amp; IMAX. Bring your own bikes or rent them nearby from Canyon Adventures Bike Tours &amp; Cafe.\n5. Join a Star Party\nSee the stars on your trip (Photo courtesy Town of Tusayan)\nEvery July and August in Tusayan, local astronomers host Astronomy Nights, an educational exploration into the solar system. Get all your burning questions answered about constellations, planets, and distant galaxies—and maybe even catch a shooting star if you’re lucky. Events happen every second Thursday and Sunday after dusk at the Tusayan-Montane Campground, or every fourth Thursday and Sunday at the Tusayan Sports Complex.\n6. Go Horseback Riding\nRather than walk, bike or drive, adventure the Wild West way: by horse. The one tour operator in town is called Grand Canyon Trail Rides, and they lead rides of varying lengths through the Kaibab National Forest. All levels of riders, from first-timers to the more experienced, are welcome. Not comfortable on a horse? Join a wagon ride instead—one 30-minute ride serves root beer—and stay afterwards for the hot dog roast around the campfire.\nPlan Your Visit\nFor More Information:\nTusayan Town Hall\n849 Mustang Drive\nTusayan, AZ 86023\n(928) 638-9909\nExplore.Tusayan-AZ.gov",

And while there are various methods for doing so, filters remain the most popular, as they are lightweight, affordable, and work almost instantly to treat water from any natural source. But most hikers know that over time, a filter&#8217;s flow rate will decrease, or it may clog altogether. If maintained properly, however, a water filter can last for year and years.

We can go for chemical solutions like chlorine or iodine. We can also use UV light to disinfect it, but the most common solution on trails nowadays by far are hollow fiber filters. You see these in all sorts of different forms. For most backpackers, the most common ones are going to be squeeze-style compact filters like the Sawyer Squeeze or like the filter I have here, which is the Platypus QuickDraw. These are really light, really easy to use, and they filter out the vast, vast majority of pathogens. But they do have a downside, which is unlike chemical solutions and unlike UV light, they can clog.\nSo today we&#8217;re going to go over an essential skill for how to maintain your filter, and that is backflushing.\nTo understand why filters clog, it&#8217;s important to understand how they work. So in its simplest form, a filter is basically a bunch of really, really tiny straws. And when I say tiny, I mean tiny. We&#8217;re talking 1 to 2 microns. That is a fraction the width of a human red blood cell. When you force water through these straws in a hollow fiber filter, they let the water through, but don&#8217;t allow any of the contaminants through. The result is clean, drinkable water you can depend on.\nOver time, mud, silt, and dirt can get stuck in these fibers and reduce the flow of your filter, or even stop it entirely. At this point, backflushing is the best way to deal with it.\nThink of a milkshake. If you&#8217;ve ever been drinking a milkshake and gotten a piece of cookie dough or a chocolate chip stuck in the straw, you know it&#8217;s a lot easier to blow out to dislodge it than to try and suck it all the way through. That&#8217;s basically what backflushing is. You take the filter and you run clean water through the clean end and out the dirty end to force those contaminants out.\nSo before we get to how to backflush, it&#8217;s worth talking about how to prevent your filter from clogging in the first place. There are some things you can do because it&#8217;s a lot easier to prevent this than to maintain your filter.\nFirst of all, be careful with your water source selection. If you&#8217;ve ever been on a big high-flow river, you know there&#8217;s a lot of silt in it. That&#8217;s why on a lot of river trips or a lot of trails that follow rivers, it&#8217;s smart to pick tributaries and little streams that might run a little more clear, that way you&#8217;re putting less stress on your filter.\nThe same goes for backpacking in the mountains. If you&#8217;ve ever seen a really beautiful, brilliant turquoise mountain lake, especially in a glaciated area, that color is caused by rock flour, which is really, really finely powdered rock, suspended in the water. You run that through your filter, you will break it in no time.\nSometimes though, you might not have a choice of what water source to use. That can be the case in the desert. Last time I was in Canyonlands, the only sources I had available were these muddy, silty puddles. It was either that or nothing.\nIn cases like these, it can be smart to pre-filter. That&#8217;s basically when you just run the water through a bandana or other cloth to take out larger particles of dirt and silt. However, that can be really time-consuming.\nSo this is where backflushing comes in. How specifically you backflush your filter, or even if you can—because you can&#8217;t backflush all filters—comes down to what model you have. Make sure to read your filter&#8217;s instructions; that will give you some helpful tips.\nThe equipment you need varies. If you&#8217;ve ever bought a Sawyer Squeeze, you know that frequently they come with those big oversized syringes that you use to clean them out. If you have a Squeeze, that&#8217;s the best thing to use.\nWhat I have here is this Platypus QuickDraw, like I mentioned. It actually flushes with a normal narrow-mouth plastic bottle. If you are using a Smartwater bottle as your reservoir, that&#8217;s perfect for this. You can use that same bottle to backflush it. It&#8217;s only going to touch the clean end so you don&#8217;t have to worry about it getting contaminated.\nI have a little bit of a Mountain Dew problem, so I have this empty Mountain Dew bottle that I have filled up from my kitchen sink. If you&#8217;re going to follow my instructions, pro tip: Do not forget to drink the Mountain Dew first. You could try and backflush your filter with Mountain Dew. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s gonna go very well.\nSo let&#8217;s head outside and give this a try.\nOK, so I have here my plastic bottle and I have my filter. I&#8217;m just gonna pop both caps off of this filter. So we have the clean end and the dirty end. So I&#8217;m gonna open up my plastic bottle. And what I&#8217;m gonna do is I&#8217;m just gonna press the lip of this bottle to the drinking end. And you can see how tight the seal it forms is. There&#8217;s not really any water leaking out. This is specific to this model of filter. Again, I emphasize, check the instruction manual.\nAnd I&#8217;m gonna give this bottle a little bit of a squeeze. And you can see the water flowing out the bottom. It&#8217;s flowing out without too much trouble. That&#8217;s because I already cleaned this filter once, but it could probably do with another backflush.\nAnd what you see here is pretty much it. You&#8217;re just gonna squeeze through an entire bottle of water. It helps to probably do it twice. I usually would do about two of these. And you will have a nice, clean, and hopefully fast-flowing filter.\nSo after this is done, you&#8217;re gonna want to dry your filter out if you don&#8217;t plan on using it right away. It&#8217;s also a good idea, especially now as it&#8217;s getting cold in this part of the year, to keep your filter from freezing. If your filter freezes, it&#8217;s going to break. It may become dangerous if you use it or not work at all. So if the temperature is going to dip below freezing, make sure you keep this warm either in your jacket or in your sleeping bag with you.",

    "body_content": "It was an unforgettable day in Kona – for the better for some, and for the worse for others. As usual on the Big Island, the swell and chop made the swim challenging, the ~ 6,000 feet of elevation added up on the bike, and the run became a battle of attrition as the heat radiated off the infamous Queen K Highway.\nThrough those punishing conditions, Solveig Lovseth (NOR) delivered another historic Norwegian debut – a winning performance that stunned and inspired. Kat Matthews (GBR) charged from 14 minutes down off the bike, setting a new run course record to secure second by just 35 seconds, while Laura Philipp (DEU) gritted through a tough day to earn another Kona podium.\nHowever, the other side of the story is typically less reported – 10 of the 54 pro women who started did not finish at last weekend’s 2025 Ironman World Championship in Kona. There’s often even more to learn from the hardships and resilience of those who gave everything to reach the finish, yet came up short. The struggles of Lucy Charles-Barclay (GBR) and Taylor Knibb (USA) were visible for all to see, but so too were their grit and will to win. These races will sting for now, but those experiences could fuel a fire that reshapes the course of their careers.\nHere, we take a closer look at what happened – and what these setbacks might mean moving forward.\nDNFs at Kona 2025\nTaylor Knibb and Lucy Charles-Barclay run next to each other during the 2025 Ironman World Championship where they both DNF&#8217;d on the run course.

    "item_title": "5 Essential Hip Flexor Exercises to Strengthen These Overlooked Muscles",
    "item_subtitle": "Whether you're an athlete or prefer to hang on the couch, these will improve your quality of life.",
    "body_content": "One of the things that quickly became obvious when I began working as an athletic trainer and yoga teacher is that most athletes place a disproportionate emphasis on &#8220;opening the hips&#8221; by practicing stretches for the hip flexors. But what most everyone overlooks is practicing the equally critical hip flexor strengthening exercises for these overstretched muscles.\nResearch indicates that practicing hip flexor strengthening exercises could reduce the likelihood of injury and improve athletic performance for runners. It might also lessen the progression of mobility decline among aging populations. Conversely, weak hip flexors can impede the ability to navigate everyday activities with ease.\nYet we’re overly focused on stretching the hip flexors, resulting in an imbalance in our bodies that plays out each time we take a step.\nWhat Are the Hip Flexors?\nStrong hip flexors are essential for running, hiking, walking, cycling, and climbing stairs, among other forms of exercise and activities of everyday life. The hip flexors comprise a group of muscles located at the top of the leg at the front of the hip and pelvis. As the name implies, the hip flexors help flex the leg at the hip, which is the movement that brings your leg toward your chest, such as when you climb stairs or initiate a step forward as you walk or run.\nThe primary hip flexor muscles are the psoas major and the iliacus (together called the iliopsoas). Muscles that assist include the rectus femoris (one of the muscles in the quads), the sartorius, and the pectineus.\n The psoas (left), sartorius (center), and tenor fasciae latae (right) are some of the hip flexor muscles, which are responsible for much of the range of motion in your lower body.  (Illustrations: Sebastian Kaulitzski | Getty)\nWhy You Need Hip Flexor Strengthening Exercises\nWhen the hip flexors are weak, your body needs to compensate by overworking other supportive muscles. Additionally, weak hip flexors can cause alignment problems in the hips and knees, and change the way your body has to move. These altered mechanics can cause muscle and joint aches, strains, and pain. For example, weak hip flexors have been shown to contribute to back, hip, and knee pain and decreased running efficiency. They can also increase the risk of certain injuries and compromise your performance in running and almost anything.\nAs an example, take a runner training for her first half marathon. She was experiencing intermittent pain in her knee and IT band (along the outer hip and knee). A movement assessment identified hip flexor muscle imbalances by revealing she was turning her foot outward. This was caused by hip flexors that were too weak to lift her leg straight up. Instead, she needed to recruit the support of other muscles along the sides of her glutes and around the ankles to bend those joints outward to “shorten” the leg enough to not scrape her foot on the ground while running. As a result, she was overworking very small muscle groups that normally just stabilize the joints.\nThe good news is that hip flexor exercises can help you circumvent pain and injury. Following are some of the most effective hip flexor exercises, whether you’re an experienced athlete or someone who sits all day.\n5 Best Hip Flexor Strengthening Exercises\nYou don’t need any equipment for most of these. If you’re new to hip flexor strengthening, experience weak hip flexors, or are rehabbing a hip flexor injury, start with these hip flexor exercises that utilize only body weight.\nFor most of the hip flexor strengthening exercises, I recommend starting with two sets of exercises that are within your ability range. If you are looking to increase your muscular endurance, you can add a third set as your hip flexor strength improves. Build up to 3 sets of 15-20 reps. If you&#8217;re looking to build hip flexor strength to maximize performance with more explosive activities like running, consider adding more resistance and sticking with two sets of 8 to 12 reps\nAs you get stronger, you can add resistance in the form of ankle weights or resistance bands Here are some of the simplest and most effective hip flexor exercises.\n\n(Photo: Brad Kaminski; Model: Jenna Edwards)\n\n1. Straight Leg Raises\nStraight leg raises are one of the best hip flexor strengthening exercises for beginners. They’re exceptionally easy to practice and all you need is your body. You’re essentially lying on your back and lifting one leg straight toward the ceiling. The movement isolates the hip flexors. As you get stronger, you can use an ankle weight for added resistance.\n1. Lie on your back with your hands on the mat at your sides. Bend one knee and bring that foot flat on the mat and keep your other leg straight.\n2. The straightened leg is the one that you’ll be moving. Keep your leg straight and your toes pointed toward the ceiling as you inhale and slowly lift the leg upward. You’ll need to engage your core muscles to keep your lower back flat on the floor.\n3. Lift your leg as far as you can without having to bend your knee. If you experience tightness in your hamstrings, that will limit how far you can lift your leg.\n4. Exhale as you slowly lower your leg back down but don&#8217;t allow the back of your heel to actually touch the ground. Just before it does, contract your hip flexors as you inhale and lift your leg again to start the next rep.\n5. Build up to 15 to 20 reps and then switch legs.\n2. Angled Leg Raises \nThis modification externally rotates the hip, which helps isolate the iliopsoas muscle.\n1. Perform the same straight leg raises but with the toes of your straight leg turned outward about 45 degrees.\n(Photo: Brad Kaminski; Model: Jenna Edwards)\n3. Boat Pose\nOne of the main reasons sit-ups have been replaced by other ab exercises in core workouts is because studies have found that sit-ups activate the hip flexor muscles as much, if not more, than the abs. But who needs sit-ups when you can turn to yoga for a better (and less curse-inducing!) alternative?\nBut here’s the good news: Boat Pose is a better alternative to sit-ups because you still get that fabulous hip flexor strengthening without being tempted to fall back on momentum. This increases the workload on the hip flexors and core since you have to hold your trunk and legs up.\n1. Come into Boat Pose by sitting with your knees bent and your feet flat on the mat in front of you. Start to lean backward and lift your feet off the mat. You can straighten your legs or bend your knees and hover your feet above the floor or even lightly touch your heels to the mat.\n2. Reach your arms alongside your legs or bring them to the backs of your thighs. Focus on keeping your back straight by drawing your abs toward your spin and bringing your low back forward. If you feel rounding in your lower back, bend your knees or take your heels to the mat.\n3. Stay here for several breaths. Don&#8217;t hold your breath.\n(Photo: Brad Kaminski; Model: Jenna Edwards)\n4. Resisted Hip Hikes\nMost hip flexor strengthening exercises are performed lying down. But in everyday life, our hip flexors work when we are upright to resist gravity, whether we’re walking, running, climbing stairs, stepping onto a curb, or hiking. This hip-strengthening exercise mimics that position and also works your core muscles.\nThe motion is similar to many movements on the yoga mat, such as anytime you lift one leg toward the chest or step forward from Downward-Facing Dog. You can use an ankle weight instead of a resistance band.\n1. Stand upright with a resistance band looped around something low to the ground. Face away from the anchor point with the band looped across the top of your foot. Start with a good amount of tension on the band.\n2. Lift the knee on your leg with the band upward toward your chest. You can hold onto a wall or back of a chair for support or you can pump your arms as if you’re running (opposite arm and opposite leg moving together).\n3. When your knee is as close to your chest as possible, pause and hold that position, engaging your muscles to resist the pull of gravity, for 2 to 3 seconds.\n4. Take your time as you lower your foot back to the mat. You want to release as slowly as possible to maximize the engagement of the hip flexors.\n5. Perform 10 to 15 reps and then switch legs.\n(Photo: Brad Kaminski; Model: Jenna Edwards)\n5. Plank Pose Knee to Elbow \nPlank is one of the best yoga poses for strengthening the core, shoulders, and glutes, but you can also progress this exercise to target the hip flexors by drawing your leg forward toward the elbow. It also engages obliques (side abs).\n1. Start in a push-up or Plank, keeping your core engaged and your hips in line with your body. It is important to maintain this alignment throughout the exercise.\n2. Keep your upper body and hips as still as possible and draw one knee forward and toward the same-side elbow while holding your hands and upper body in a static position, bringing it as close to the elbow as possible. Remember to keep your hips in line with the rest of your body. Hold for 15-30 seconds.\n3. Step your foot back into Plank. Rest as needed and then switch sides.",

    "body_content": "On October 12, the Piolets D’Or (“Golden Ice Axes”), also known as mountaineering’s biggest honor, released a longlist of 78 “significant, innovative ascents” completed in 2024. According to the press release, most of the accomplishments last year involved “new ground and technical climbing in lightweight style.”\nThis preliminary list was compiled by Lindsay Griffin, a senior editor of the American Alpine Journal and contributor to the Himalayan Database. Rodolphe Popier, senior contributor to the Himalayan Database, and Dougald MacDonald, Editor in Chief of the American Alpine Journal, also helped compile the list.\nIn the past two years, the final awards have been announced by the end of October. In the meantime, check out our main takeaways from the longlist—and see if you can guess who will win the 2025 Piolets d’Or.\nStyle over everything\nThe Piolets d’Or have honored some of the world’s best-known alpinists and climbers, including Ueli Steck, George Lowe, David Lama, Jeff Lowe, Steve House, Marko Prezelj, Tommy Caldwell, Alex Honnold, Hayden Kennedy, Thomas Huber, and Reinhold Messner.\nSince 1992, the French Groupe de Haute Montagne (the “High Mountain Group”) has announced the best mountaineering-related achievements of the prior year. In 2009, following criticism of the one-winner policy, the Groupe de Haute Montagne began recognizing multiple winners.\nThe Piolets d’Or Charter establishes the intention to promote ethical style and the practice of “doing more with less.” The charter specifically calls out bottled oxygen, fixed ropes, performance-enhancing substances, and high-altitude porters as counterexamples to good style. These practices can all, of course, be found on the average Mount Everest expedition.\nSeveral deceased climbers appear on this year’s longlist. American climber Michael Gardner is mentioned for his, Sam Hennessey, and Rob Smith’s partial new route, One Way Out (WI6 M6; 2,200m) on the Diamond Arête on the east face of Mt. Hunter (4,442m) in Alaska. The 32-year-old died in a fall on Jannu East in Nepal, five months after the Mt. Hunter expedition.\nAnother posthumous mention recognizes the first ascent of the east face of Langtang Lirung (7,227m) in Nepal, completed by Slovakian climber Ondrej Húserka and Czech climber Marek Holeček. Húserka died on the descent from basecamp after falling into a crevasse.\n2024 Piolets d’Or recap\nLast year’s winners included three teams. Americans Matt Cornell, Jackson Marvell, and Alan Rousseau received a Piolet d’Or for their first ascent of Round Trip Ticket (M7 AI5+ A0; 2,700m). This partial new route on the north face of Jannu (7,710m) in Nepal left both Marvell and Rousseau with frostbitten fingers.\nSwiss climbers Hugo Béguin, Matthias Gribi, and Nathan Monard won for their first ascent of Tomorrow is Another Day (5c WI2 M6 A2) on the north face of Flat Top (6,100m) in India.\nFinally, the Piolets d’Or recognized Japanese alpinists Kazuya Hiraide and Takero “Kenro” Nakajima, who also won in 2020, for their first ascent of The Secret Line (3,108m) on the north face of Tirich Mir (7,708m) in Pakistan. Both Hiraide and Nakajima survived their Tirich Mir expedition, but died shortly after in a fall on the west face of K2.\nItalian climber Nives Meroi also won the 2024 Special Mention for Female Mountaineering for her second ascent of Kabru South (7,318m) on Kanchenjanga along with Peter Hámor, Bojan Janher, and her husband, Romano Benet. They ascended the west face of Kabru South via a new route, Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes (D+ 60°; 2,800m), in a four-day alpine style push.\nHighlights of the 2025 longlist\nThis year&#8217;s longlist features 78 ascents or other accomplishments, most in teams of one to four climbers, completed in 2024 across 13 locations. By the numbers, 16 occurred in Nepal, 11 in the Alps, eight in Pakistan, eight in India, seven in Tibet, seven in China, six in Alaska, five in Chile, three in Peru, three in Greenland, two in Norway, and one each in Canada and Greece.\nOn adventures that made the longlist, alpinists fended off polar bears, ate whales, shared an inflatable portaledge, and celebrated a 50-year friendship. Check out Climbing’s in-depth coverage of several longlisted routes below:\n\nYosemite-based trio Brandon Adams, Miles Fullman, and Sam Stuckey’s first ascent of Memento Mori (5.10 A5; 1,100m) on the west face of the south tower of Mount Asgard (2,015m) and Ragnarok (5.11 A5; 750m) on the west face of Frigga I (1,264m)\nSlovenian Aleš Česen and British Tom Livingstone’s first ascent of the west ridge of Gasherbrum III (7,958m) via Edge of Entropy (3,000m with possible M6) in the Pakistani Karakorum\nJapanese climbers Hidesuke Taneishi and Hiroki Yamamoto’s first ascent of Pholesobi (6,652m) via the North Face Direct (1,500m) in Nepal\nThe first ascent of Odyssea Borealis (5.12b R; 1,200m) on the northwest face of Drøneren in Greenland by Matteo Della Bordella (Italy), Alex Gammeter (Switzerland), Silvian Schüpbach (Switzerland), and Symon Welfringer (France)\nBritish duo Mick Fowler and Victor Saunders’s first ascent of Yawash Sar (6,258m) via the west-northwest face (~800m) in the Pakistani Karakorum\nSpanish ultrarunner Kilian Jornet’s 19-day linkup of all 82 4,000m peaks in the Alps by foot and bike—an eco-pointing practice that he repeated when he ran up 72 American 14ers last month\n\nTriple mentions for O’Driscoll and Obino\nThis year, two athletes are each mentioned three times in the longlist: Irish-Belgian alpinist Sean Villanueva O’Driscoll and French alpinist Baptiste Obino.\nO’Driscoll, age 44, with two prior Piolet d’Or wins in 2011 and 2022, kicked off 2024 by making the first free ascent of Riders on the Storm (7c+; 1,300m) on the east face of the Torre Central in Chile’s Torres del Paine National Park alongside his teammates Nicolas Favresse, Siebe Vanhee, and photographer Drew Smith.\nShortly afterward, in February, O’Driscoll linked all four Torres del Paine, establishing Traversía Double M (5.11 A2; 2,200m) and marking the first time that all four summits had been connected. Finally, in August, he joined Sean Warren, Pete Whittaker, and Julia Cassou in Greenland to make the first ascent of Ryu-Shin (5.13d R A2+; 1,950m) on the northwest face of Mirror Wall.\nThe 25-year-old French alpinist Baptiste Obino stayed a bit closer to home, putting up new, challenging mixed lines around France. In early January 2024, Obino teamed up with Philippe Bruley and Amaury Fouillade to make the first ascent of Petit Pont (5.10 M5 A3; 1,000m) on the west face of the Petit Dru in Chamonix, France.\nThe next month, Obino traveled three hours away to Oisans, where he promptly established, alone, Pantouglage et Sabotage (5.11- M7 WI5+ A2; 750m) on the south face of Brèche Zsigmondy (3,925m) on La Meije, Écrins Massif.\nAt the end of the year, in December, Obino returned to Écrins Massif to put up another route—this time, with Victor Garcin and Nicolas Jean. Their first ascent of La Barretasse (5.10+ WI5 M5 A1; 900m) on the south-southeast face of the Barre des Écrins (4,101m) rounded out Obino’s third longlist mention for the 2024 Piolets d’Or.\nPetek and Verdev honored for Himalayan first ascent\nIn addition to the longlist, the Piolets d’Or committee announced that the 2025 Special Mention for Female Mountaineering will go to Anja Petek and Patricija Verdev from Slovenia. In September 2024, Patek and Verdev made the first ascent of Lalung I (6,243m) in the Indian Himalaya via a new route, Here Comes the Sun (M6+ AI5+; 2,000m). The Piolet d’Or jury described their five-day push as “a pure alpine style ascent over technical ground” and praised the team’s commitment in the face of poor weather.\nAside from this distinctive mention, about 7% of the longlisted alpinists are women. Among those is Masha Gordon, who founded the Grit &amp; Rock Expedition Award to fund first ascents by female climbers. The 2025 longlist includes the British alpinist’s first ascent of Mashallah Sar (6,043m) via the west face (WI4 M4; 1,000m) in Pakistan, alongside her teammates Oswaldo Freire, Joshua Jerrín, and Jacques Sturm.\nIn a notable display of women supporting women, three of the 2024 Grit &amp; Rock Expedition award winners also appear on the longlist: Olga Lukashenko, Anastasia Kozlova, and Daria Seyupova. This all-female team made the first ascent of the north face and upper west ridge of Argo (4,750m) in Kyrgyzstan. Supported by $2,000 from Gordon’s organization, the Russian trio established a 29-pitch, 1,250-meter route, grading it 7b M5 A3. In December, the team received the All-Around Best Climb award at 2024 Russian Piolets D’Or, which is unaffiliated with the Piolets d’Or.\nCheck out the full list of significant climbs here.",

There are natural elements to consider, including temperature, wind, and snow. Then there are psychological factors, like dreading the transition between warm car and freezing trail. Wear too little and there’s a chance of frostbite or hypothermia—especially during a long ski. Wear too much, and you’ll sweat, then overheat, and eventually freeze.\nThe best way to avoid this over-under-dressing dilemma is to follow three simple rules: Always wear breathable, wicking layers. On warmer days, less is always more. And always keep a change of clothes and a plush puffy in the car.

    "item_title": "Meet the Thru-Hiker Intent on Building Mexico's First Long Trail",
    "item_subtitle": "After becoming the first Mexican to complete the Triple Crown of hiking, Zelzin Aketzalli has an even bigger dream: building Baja California’s first thru-trail.",
    "body_content": "The journey that Zelzin Aketzalli is on could take 50 years—or even longer—but she’s not daunted. In 2019, she became the first Mexican to complete hiking’s Triple Crown (the Appalachian, Pacific Crest, and Continental Divide Trails), and the 31-year-old immediately dreamed up an even more ambitious project: developing the first national trail system in her home country. The inaugural installment is a prospective 1,300-mile trail across Baja California, which Aketzalli has mapped out across a trailless expanse of mountains, desert, canyons, and beach.\nAketzalli says her experiences thru-hiking the Triple Crown helped her discover her true passion for long-distance trekking. Though she was already an accomplished athlete when she logged her first mile on the PCT, she had spent more time on a bike than on her feet.\nAketzalli grew up in Iztapalapa in Mexico City, the most densely populated neighborhood in one of the world’s most densely populated cities. From the outside, it might not seem like an ideal setting for someone who loved the outdoors, but Aketzalli’s father, a multisport athlete who had been a respected alpinist in the 1980s, trained her in several sports. Some of her earliest memories are of her father waking her at 5 a.m. to go running before he took her and her brother to school on his bike.\nAs a kid, Aketzalli was drawn to skateboarding, and sought her first job at the age of 11 in a tianguis, one of Mexico City’s open-air markets, to pay for skate shoes and save up money for college. She took swimming lessons, and in high school, she joined the rowing team. But her eyes were always pulled toward the mountains in the distance, the peaks of volcanoes Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl practically calling her name.\nIt wasn’t long before she took up mountain biking and began setting the kinds of ambitious goals that would come to define her adventuring career. She competed in a national mountain biking competition after training alone on the trails.\nAketzalli was a phenom on the bike, but she soon became aware of its limits. “When you’re riding, you’ve got to stick to where the bike can go,” she says. “I’d pass all these paths that drew my attention. I always had the curiosity to go beyond, and on the bike, I couldn’t do it.”\nAketzalli realized that while she loved cycling, it wasn’t her passion. “I didn’t see myself doing this day after day,” she says. She graduated with a degree from the Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Mexico’s most prestigious engineering school. But that, she says, was just a strategic goal: “I hadn’t found my calling.”\nHer calling wasn’t far away, and she’d discover it thanks to two unexpected people: cyclists from the United States who’d ridden from California to Mexico City. “I took them out to see the city. I wanted to show them the mountains, and maybe I said something about wanting to go deeper, beyond where I could reach with my bike,” she recalls. “And they said, ‘Did you know there’s a trail that crosses the whole United States?’”\nThe encounter lit a spark in her. She’d already seen the movie Wild, based on Cheryl Strayed’s memoir by the same name, but hadn’t realized the scale of the trail it depicted. She went back to watch the film again. This time, she paid attention to the trail, its signage, the distances, and its challenges. It was November 2016. By April 2017, she was on the PCT.\nAketzalli trained in the months leading up to her first thru-hike, but her training faced lots of obstacles. She had never experienced snow before, so to prepare, she began hiking 17,159-foot Iztaccíhuatl, eager to learn how to use an ice axe and crampons. But she never got the chance: It was March, and conditions were dry. While summiting Iztaccíhuatl, she also discovered she was afraid of heights. And then, she realized she had another fear to confront.\n“I wasn’t afraid of getting lost on the Pacific Crest Trail,” she says, “but I was afraid I wouldn’t know how to ask for help if I needed it.” At the time, she didn’t speak English beyond a few words.\nUltimately, none of those fears stopped her: “I learned English while hiking,” she says, thanks to a combination of Google Translate, hand gestures, and a series of notebooks, where other hikers drew maps and images of landmarks for her.\nThe PCT—her first thru-hike—was transformative, and by the time she finished the Sierra, she knew she had found her calling. Along the way, Aketzalli had heard hikers talk about the Triple Crown, and she decided to make it her next goal. Between 1994 and the end of 2024, only 775 hikers achieved Triple Crown status. Aketzalli soon became one of them, and the first Mexican. She finished the last of the 7,910 cumulative miles in September 2019.\nAfter completing the Triple Crown, Aketzalli set her sights on constructing Mexico&#8217;s first long trail. (Photo: Tommy Corey)\nBy the time she reached the AT, Aketzalli was already contemplating another project: building a national trail system in Mexico. When she talked to people in Mexico, “I could see they were as amazed as I had been that trail systems existed … and I felt there was a need to have that in Mexico,” she says. “I just had to figure out where and how.”\nAs she hiked, Aketzalli thought back to an earlier trip she’d taken to the Mexican state of San Luis Potosí when she was 18 years old.\n“I saw this mountain that really called my attention and I wanted to go there,” she says. But upon arriving, she learned that she’d have to pay someone from the community to guide her. “I was self-confident and I was a student, so I didn’t have money, so I said, ‘I can go on my own.’” The community was clear: no guide, no hike. At first, it frustrated her, but the experience led to a life-changing conversation that’s shaping the way she thinks about the national trail system she’s now designing.\n“The man told me, ‘My kids left here for the city because they didn’t like the country … They don’t want anything to do with this place because there’s nothing here,’” Aketzalli recalls. “‘But this is my heritage, it’s my land.’” He explained to Aketzalli that most people don’t want to leave their communities, but they don’t have a way to support themselves. She suddenly understood the need for paid guides leading visitors like her.\n“I understood that it was important to create income in this community,” she says. “Because I’m from a poor background, that stayed in my mind.”\nIn 2020, as Aketzalli was mapping out the route for the first trail in what she envisions as a national system, that experience kept coming back to her. She wants to be sure that the trails she designs benefit everyone, especially Mexicans and Latin Americans, particularly “the ones who can’t come to the U.S. to do trails.” But the other main goal is to ensure that the trail supports local communities, so that rural residents—especially those that are Indigenous—don’t have to leave their land.\nThis month, Aketzalli will begin formally scouting the new trail. She says that it could be decades before the route is complete.\n“There’s nothing right now where this trail will be,” says Aketzalli. The trail will cross 1,300 miles of terrain, featuring ocean, mountain, and desert landscapes, and it will run from the Mexico-U.S. border in Baja California Norte all the way to the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. “It’s all wild. It’s bush-walking,” she says. “We are starting from zero, from nothing. It’s a long process.”\nIf designing and building a trail is a massive undertaking in any country, it is a project that faces unique challenges in Mexico. For one, Aketzalli notes, thru-hiking as a concept is not part of the country’s collective consciousness, and importing an idea and a term that originated in the U.S. is fraught, particularly in this political moment.\nFurthermore, Aketzalli wants to ensure that visiting hikers treat communities along the trail with the utmost respect.\n“These people have lived here for generations,” she says. “They have so much culture, and we want the route to highlight their culture, but always with the idea that we [hikers] are there to learn from them, not we’re there to teach them something. This is a key part of the trail—to learn about the history of Mexico and to learn from native communities.”\nIn addition to cultural immersion, Aketzalli’s trail will feature what every thru-hiker lives for: physical challenges and access to nature.\n“When one talks about Baja, they think of the beach,” she says. “But Baja is so much more than that. It has natural riches that are so diverse: It has snow-capped mountains. It has canyons. It has desert … It has so much nature and animal life that exists nowhere else.”\nSo far, in her initial scouting expeditions, Aketzalli has garnered support from communities where the proposed trail will pass through. It’s a route she mapped out during the pandemic and one she intends to walk in full this fall. She understands that, at the end of the day, it will inevitably look much different than her vision. For one, she says, communities may change their minds about whether and how they want to be involved, and she will always respect their wishes. For another, there are the usual obstacles associated with trail-building anywhere in the world: permits, land use rights, logistics, money.\nBut for now, Aketzalli says, this project is all about putting one foot in front of the other and overcoming obstacles as they appear, just as she did on the Triple Crown. Her goal this fall is to prove that building Mexico’s first national trail—however far in the future it may be—is within reach.\n“So many people say it’s impossible,” she says. “We have to demonstrate that it is possible. I want to see more Mexicans thru-hiking. I believe wholly that a trail changes lives. I want to change the history of Mexico.”",

    "item_subtitle": "Everything climbers should know about flying with climbing gear",
    "body_content": "When my partner and I started saving for a trip to Southeast Asia, our nights turned into planning sessions—maps open, tabs multiplying. We drooled over noodle videos and daydreamed about deep water soloing. My partner—who’s one life goal since I’ve known him has been to get back to the beach—was finally getting his wish. I doubt he’ll move once we get there.\nI, on the other hand, was dreaming about climbing. Compared to Alaskan schist, which crumbles if you breathe wrong, Southeast Asia promised real rock—limestone, granite, sandstone. I was ecstatic. But there was one problem: the trip was long, and we’d agreed to travel with a single backpack each.\nSo, how would navigate flying with climbing gear? And what happens when an ultralight guy and a climber girl plan a months-long trip overseas? Weeks of debate about ounces, rope lengths, cams, and whether TSA would confiscate our chalk. Our household has turned into a gear weigh-in. He holds up a carabiner and asks if I really need it. I hold up a shirt and ask the same.\nMost nights end the same way: Both of us cross-legged on the floor, tabs open to the TSA website, Reddit threads, and climbing forums. We attempt to answer very specific, very unromantic questions: What can we actually fly with? And do we have to check the gear bag?\nWhat I’ve learned from those nights is that climbing gear doesn&#8217;t meet its greatest challenge on rock, but in an overhead bin. After weeks of research, I finally pieced together a few real answers.\nFAQs: Flying with climbing gear\n(Photo: Ryleigh Norgrove)\nCan I bring my rope in my carry-on?\nYes. Ropes are allowed in both carry-on and checked bags under TSA’s sporting-equipment rules. Keep it clean and flaked—mud or grit can flag your bag for extra screening. If you’ve got weight to spare, a rope coils neatly into a backpack and rides fine in the overhead bin. Otherwise, stuff it in your checked duffel, surrounded by soft gear. You are also technically allowed to store the rope on top of your pack coiled as long as it&#8217;s secured to the bag.\nCan I carry cams, nuts, and carabiners on the plane?\nUsually, yes. Carabiners, cams, quickdraws, slings, and nuts are fine in both carry-on and checked luggage, though agents may ask you to unpack or explain them. Pack the rack neatly, clip everything closed, and consider tucking it into a small pouch so it doesn’t rattle.\nNut tools are the one item to check—sharp edges can classify them as tools or blades. (As always, the final call rests with the TSA screening officer.)\nWhat about ice gear—axes, screws, and crampons?\nCheck it all. Anything sharp or pointed—ice axes, tools, screws—must go in checked luggage, sheathed or padded. Crampons are sometimes allowed in carry-ons, but agents can overrule that. If you’re feeling daring, improve your odds by waiting to file those sharp ends until you arrive at your destination! But you’ll have a smoother trip if they’re packed and padded in a checked bag.\nWill my gear get damaged if I check it?\nUsually not, but checked bags do take hits. Protect your hardware by using a rigid or semi-rigid duffel, wrapping cams and carabiners in clothes and capping anything sharp. Keep metal parts in a small inner bag to avoid scraping. If you’re traveling with a partner, split the rack—better to lose half than all of it.\nShould I carry my harness, shoes, or helmet with me?\nYes. Keep fit-specific or irreplaceable gear—like a helmet, harness, and shoes—in your carry-on. They’re light, expensive, and easy to misplace in transit. Helmets and harnesses fly fine; just make sure your chalk bag’s sealed.\nSpeaking of, can I bring chalk on the plane?\nYes. Powder and block chalk are allowed in carry-on luggage, but quantities over 12 oz (350 mL) may be screened separately. Liquid chalk must follow the 3-1-1 liquid rule (under 3.4 oz / 100 mL). Keep chalk sealed or labeled so it’s not mistaken for mystery powder.\nI’m developing some routes! What about bolts, hangers, or drills?\nCheck them. Anything that looks like a tool—hammer, wrench, drill bit, bolt kit—has to go in checked baggage. Wrap the gear, tape it together, or pack it inside a small toolbox to prevent damage to other items.\nAre satellite communicators and GPS devices legal everywhere?\nNo. Two-way satellite communicators (like Garmin inReach, SPOT, and Zoleo) are restricted or completely illegal in several countries due to national security risks, regulatory interests and competing commercial communication, including:\n\nIndia: The U.S. State Department warns not to bring a satellite phone or GPS device. Possession or use without a government license can lead to fines or arrest.\nChina: Mapping and surveying equipment is restricted. Unlicensed devices that transmit location data may be confiscated.\nVietnam and some neighboring Southeast Asian countries have vague or inconsistent rules around satellite communicators; check before you fly.\n\nIf you’re uncertain, disable satellite transmission before you land or leave the device at home. Paper maps and local SIM cards beat an airport interrogation.\nHow do I keep my gear from raising suspicion at security?\n\nPack neatly—no loose jangling metal.\nLabel your bag “Climbing Gear: Non-Hazardous Sporting Equipment.”\nKeep a guidebook or topo visible on top of your gear.\nStay patient if agents ask questions; they’re usually just curious.\nArrive early—extra screening is normal for metal-heavy bags.\nDress like a climber and have some awesome climbing photos on your phone at the ready to verify your identity and impress TSA agents. This one’s not for real, but hey, it can’t hurt.\n\nThe bottom line on flying with climbing gear\nYou can fly with almost everything in your kit—just separate the sharp from the soft and pack thoughtfully. Pad your gear, carry your personal items, and double-check satellite-device laws before you go. Keep it simple and obvious, and you’ll spend less time explaining cams and more time climbing.",

They&#8217;re about cultivating stability in any pose, exercise, or life situation that engages your arms, from grounding through your palms in Downward-Facing Dog to the control required in Chaturanga. And you can practice that anytime you&#8217;re on the mat, even during a simple 10-minute yoga session.\nAs your strength grows, so does your capacity to support yourself and balances effort with ease, stability with mobility. The following arm strength exercises can be incorporated into your yoga practice or after a workout to enhance the strength and stability of your arms with little additional time. Each pose dynamically challenges you and asks you to explore not only alignment but awareness and patience.\n10-Minute Yoga With Arm Strength Exercises\n\n        Video loading...\n      \nBuilding arm strength through yoga isn’t about just exercise. It’s about cultivating stability, confidence, and balance. Here&#8217;s how.\n1. Chaturanga Push-Ups\n\nChaturanga is one of the most complex postures in yoga and demands awareness. Proper alignment of the shoulders, mobility in the wrists, and strong engagement of the biceps and triceps are necessary to practice it safely and powerfully.\nHow to: \n1. From hands and knees or Plank Pose, stack your shoulders over your wrists and ground down strongly through your palms into the mat.\n2. Slowly shift your body forward until your shoulders almost stack over your middle fingertips.\n3. Slowly bend your elbows, keeping your upper arms close to but not necessarily touching your side body.\n4. You don’t need to lower very far to feel the triceps engage, but as your explore lowering more, remember to stop when your elbows reach your ribcage. You can use a yoga block under the sternum to remind yourself not to drop too low.\n5. Press up again to Tabletop or Plank and repeat 5-10 times for Chaturanga Push-Ups. Take your time.\n2. Side Plank\n\nThe triceps, serratus anterior, and triceps muscles are all strengthened in Side Plank, which lets you work on your arms one at a time.\nHow to:\n1. Face the long end of your mat with the bottom knee down and the top leg extended. Another option is to extend both legs in a full side plank.\n2. Place your bottom hand directly under your shoulder and reach your top arm toward the sky.\n3. Press down into your bottom hand to engage the triceps, serratus, and latissimus muscles.\n4. Slightly lift and lower your hips 5-10 times.\nAnother option:\n1. Begin in a Half Slide Plank with your bottom knee on the mat and your top leg straight.\n2. Exhale and press down through the bottom hand and contact the side body as you lift your bottom knee off the mat. Look down.\n\n3. Inhale and release the knee back to the mat, as you lift the top straight leg toward the sky and look up.\n4, Repeat 5-10 times.\n3. Reverse Tabletop Dips\n\nIn a world where so much of our day is forward focused, this pose activates the entire back line of the body bringing balance and harmony. It opens the chest muscles, stretches the fronts of the shoulders, and strengthens the triceps and biceps.\nHow to:\n1. Sit on your mat with your knees bent and hands behind you on the mat, fingers pointing toward your hips or slightly outward toward the front corners of your mat.\n2. Press into your hands and feet as you squeeze the glutes and lift your hips toward the sky into a Reverse Tabletop position.\n3. Exhale and bend your elbows slightly, lowering toward the mat.\n4. Inhale and straighten your arms, lifting back up into a strong tabletop.\n5. Repeat 5-10 times.\n4. Downward-Facing Dog\n\nOne of the most iconic yoga poses, Downward-Facing Dog balances stability and flexibility. When practiced with intention, this pose strengthens the arms and shoulders while decompressing the spine and opening the backs of the legs.\nHow to:\n1. Come onto your mat in a hands and knees position.\n2. Exhale, as you straighten your legs and reach your hips toward the sky.\n3. Press your hands and feet into the mat, as if you could stretch your mat longer in both directions. Actively press your hands into the mat, spreading your fingers and pushing downward as you pull your shoulder blades away from your ears and reach your sitting bones toward the sky.\n4. Hold for 3-5 breaths.\n5. Chair Pose Forearm Squeeze\n\nChair Pose builds heat in the legs, glutes, and core, and incorporating forearm squeezes brings power into the pectoralis and bicep muscles while stretching the upper back and shoulders.\nHow to:\n1. Stand on your mat with the feet together and big toes touching.\n2. Sit your hips back and down into Chair Pose, sinking your weight into your heels and squeeze your thighs together strongly.\n3. Bring your arms in front of your face, bend your elbows 90 degrees, and bring your forearms and palms together to touch. Press together strongly.\n4. Inhale as you lift your elbows toward the sky a few inches, keeping your forearms straight up and down.\n5. Exhale as you lower your elbows back to starting position in front of the chest.\n6. Repeat 5-10 times.\nAnother option:\n1. Bring your palms back together.\n2. Open your arms out into a cactus shape on an inhalation as you squeeze your shoulder blades together, broaden your chest, and lift your chin.\n\n3. Exhale and bring your palms back together in front of your face, squeezing your forearms and elbows together.\n4. Repeat 5-10 times.\n6. Warrior 2\n\nIf you find yourself zoning out while in Warrior 2, you’re not alone. To come back into your body and quiet your mind, get your arms involved.\nHow to:\n1. From Warrior 2, float your arms toward the sky.\n2. Bring your hands back down to shoulder height and parallel to the mat, flex your wrists by drawing the backs of your hands toward you, and push through your palms, as if you&#8217;re pushing the walls away from you.\n3. Inhale to bring your arms back up toward the sky.\n4. Repeat 5-10 times.\nAnother option:\n1. Start with your arms in traditional Warrior 2, extended and parallel to the ground.\n\n2. Keep your palms facing flat toward the mat and start to rotate your arms in tiny circles. Keep your shoulder blades still so all of the movement is in your arms. Keep the circles slow and small.\n3. Rotate 5-10 times, then reverse.\n4. For an extra challenge for your body and brain, try rotating each arm in the opposite direction.\n7. Standing Forward Bend Arm Stretch\n\nStretching your arms after strengthening them helps restore balance, lengthen tight muscles, and support healthy mobility.\nHow to:\n1. From standing, clasp your hands behind your back or hold onto a yoga strap or hand towel.\n2. Straighten your arms behind you and broaden across your chest.\n\n3. Exhale as you slowly fold forward, taking a slight bend in your knees as your arms reach behind you or overhead.\n4. Inhale as you slowly roll back up to standing, pulling your arms down and behind you toward the mat.\n5. Repeat 3-5 times, incorporating these arm strength exercises into not only your yoga practice but in between meetings or when you simply need a break.",

    "body_content": "Whether you identify as a morning person or cling to the covers for as long as possible, transitioning from a sleeping state to a waking one requires a significant shift in awareness. Rather than rolling out of bed and groggily—or frantically—jumping into your usual a.m. regimen, pausing to practice morning yoga provides a more mindful transition to the waking world. Consider your yoga mat to be a liminal space between dreamland and reality. Then see how much more promising the day feels post-Savasana.\n5 Morning Yoga Routines for a Mindful Wake-Up\nChoose the a.m. practice that best suits your current mood or, if it&#8217;s a wrong-side-of-the-bed type of morning, choose based on your desired mood.\n1. 15-Minute Yin Yoga for Relaxed Mornings\n(Photo: Devi Daly)\nA first-thing mini-yin flow makes for a luxurious morning. Yin yoga is all about sustained holds, although yoga teacher Devi Daly allows that if you&#8217;re in a rush, you can opt for for as long—or as little—time in each as you can spare. Practice finding stillness in the discomfort and watch that sense of inner ease permeate your entire day.\nPractice this morning flow.\n2. 10-Minute Morning Yoga + Pilates for Core Strengthening\n(Photo: Yoga with Kassandra)\nYoga with Kassandra’s hybrid of yoga and Pilates invites you to start strong. This all-levels practice welcomes anyone, although Kassandra notes that it is intense, so prepare to breathe into it. Once you&#8217;re done, any of the day&#8217;s subsequent challenges are certain to feel doable.\nPractice this morning flow.\n3. 12-Minute Yoga to Ease You Into Your Day\n(Photo: Taylor Lorenz)\nThis practice from yoga teacher Taylor Lorenz meets you exactly where you are. Invitations to indulge in intuitive movement abound, allowing you to move in exactly the way you need as you align your body, breath, and spirit. Paying special attention to your body as it wakes up also allows you to send breath and energy to any areas that feel particularly tight or stiff.\nPractice this morning flow. \n4. 15-Minute Morning Yoga to Energize Your Day\n(Photo: Andrea Marcum)\nFor those who need an energy boost to kick off the day, yoga teacher Andrea Marcum&#8217;s morning flow makes dynamic use of the body. By balancing challenging hold and transitions with moments of stillness, these 15 minutes on your mat can help put you in the right state to step into your routine.\nPractice this morning flow.\n5. 10-Minute Morning Yin for Your Lower Back\n(Photo: Renee Choi)\nIf your back feels less-than-amazing first thing in the morning, you&#8217;re not alone. Yoga teacher Neeti Narula adjusts her morning flow to suit the body&#8217;s specific needs, and created this one to address her lower back. Gentle bends and folds allow your body the space to gently adjust to the whole &#8220;being upright&#8221; thing.\nPractice this morning flow.",

    "body_content": "Tadej Pogačar isn’t just cycling’s 21st-century GOAT, he’s also drawing an eight-figure pay packet that’s Forbes rich-list worthy.\nAccording to La Gazzetta dello Sport, Pogačar&#8217;s compensation across his 2025 season could top 12 million euros, or about $14 million.\nThe Italian sports daily revealed some interesting details about bonuses and royalties that confirm earlier reporting from Velo that makes Pogačar’s best-paid cyclist.\nAfter his historic 2024 treble — winning the Giro d’Italia, Tour de France, and world championships — UAE Emirates-XRG penned its superstar through 2030 with the most lucrative deal in cycling history that includes an eye-popping €200 million buyout clause.\nThe new contract is reportedly worth €8 million per season — a €2 million pump from his previous salary — and worth an estimated €50 million in total.\nIt also comes sweetened with performance bonuses for big wins, La Gazzetta reported.\nThe bonuses include €1 million for a Tour victory, €500,000 for the Giro or Vuelta, and €250,000 for worlds. Other wins, such as the monuments and one-week stage races, do not include bonus incentives.\nIn 2025, Pogačar pocketed around €1.25 million in bonuses, slightly less than the €1.75 million haul from his triple-crown year, after adding another Tour de France and world title to his résumé, La Gazzetta reported.\n&#8216;Every year the Pogačar brand doubles&#8217;\nPogačar is always at the center of attention. (Photo: Gruber Images/Velo)\nThe Italian sports daily also estimated that Pogačar is quickly growing into a sponsorship juggernaut that is earning him up to €2 million annually in extra income beyond his UAE salary.\nAnd that number is increasing by the season.\nManaged by A&amp;J All Sports, Pogačar’s personal brand portfolio now includes Colnago, DMT, Met, Continental, Enervit, Jana, Plume, MyWhoosh, and the Slovenian Tourist Office.\nThose names might not be global mega-brands, but together they underscore Pogačar’s growing sponsorship appeal.\nMerchandising is also booming on the tailwinds of the Pogačar phenomenon, which includes the increasing profile of his personal brand.\nHis official website sells merchandise that includes the styled “TP” logo on T-shirts, jerseys, coffee mugs, socks, books, key rings, and other products, with proceeds supporting the Tadej Pogačar Foundation and a Slovenian youth academy.\nAccording to Pogacar’s manager Alex Carera, sales keep ticking up the more Pogačar keeps winning.\n“Three years ago, the personal logo was almost a whim,” Carera told La Gazzetta. “Today, it’s a fundamental part of Tadej’s image value. Every year, the Pogačar brand doubles in worth compared to the previous one.”\nLa Gazzetta reported that Pogačar also receives royalties on sales of such products as the limited-edition Colnago bikes (€17,000 each) and a slice of the Pissei race wear line that generates sales worth €30 million annually.\nWith the rise of $50 million-plus-budget super teams, Pogačar&#8217;s financial bonanza also reveals how more money than ever is flowing into the upper tiers of pro cycling.\nThough much of that windfall remains concentrated among a handful of top winners, elite male stars like Pogačar, Remco Evenepoel, and Jonas Vingegaard now command salaries and multi-year contracts that would have been unthinkable a decade ago.\nPogačar&#8217;s international profile keeps rising\nPogačar&#8217;s contract is packed with performance incentives.  (Photo: Gruber Images/Velo)\nBetween salary, bonuses, royalties, appearance fees, and other income, Pogačar earned about €12 million in 2025.\nAnd next year, Carrera says it’ll be more.\nThat’s the most any cyclist has earned since Lance Armstrong reeled in an estimated $30 million per year in salary and sponsorship deals with brands like Nike and Subaru before his USADA downfall.\nArmstrong was the rare pro cyclist who truly broke into the mainstream. Pogačar could be heading in that direction.\nPogačar is starting to pop up in more international events. For example, in mid-November, he will be the special guest at the Esports World Championships in Abu Dhabi.\nIn 2025, Pogačar was nominated for the 2025 Laureus World Sportsman of the Year award alongside such sports icons as Carlos Alcaraz, Armand Duplantis, Leon Marchand, and Max Verstappen (pole-vaulter Duplantis won).\nCycling still trails the financial firepower of U.S. major leagues or European football, but today’s elite riders are finally earning seven-figure salaries commiserate with their suffering and sacrifice on the road.\nSo far, no one&#8217;s leveraged that better than the Slovenian slugger.\nAt just 27, he looks to have at least five more seasons at the top to continue to amass his growing personal fortune.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nA post shared by Velo (@velovelovelo_)",

    "item_subtitle": "We chat with a physical therapist and rely on scientific research to help you determine the best time to stretch. Here's what to know.",
    "body_content": "Many of us barely have time to complete our to-do lists or find a spare moment for stretching, let alone contemplate the best time to stretch. So stretching often ends up happening when it can. You may swear by early morning stretching or insist that a midday approach is optimal, whereas many prefer a stretch routine to wind down before bed. It quickly becomes clear that stretch scheduling is not a one-size-fits-all endeavor.\nExperts agree that while there is indeed some flexibility (pun intended) when it comes to the best time to stretch, your decision should take your lifestyle and your goals into account. Here’s what they suggest to ensure your routine is working for you and your body.\nIs There a Best Time of Day to Stretch?\nPhysical movement affects each of us differently. A 2018 study published in Biological Rhythms Research found that dynamic stretching (routines that include movement and repetition rather than static holds) leads to increased flexibility when practiced in both the morning and the evening.\nMorning Versus Evening Stretching\nAnother note about flexibility: you&#8217;ve probably noticed that you feel a bit stiff when you wake up in the mornings. This is because your joints don&#8217;t move much at night when you&#8217;re asleep, so the surrounding synovial fluid doesn&#8217;t lubricate the joints as effectively as when you&#8217;re active. Stretching in the A.M. could help get your body moving for the day.\nIn a 2018 study published in Physiotherapy Quarterly, 60 men with tight hamstrings were divided into three stretch time groups: morning, afternoon, and night. Those who performed static hamstring stretches in the afternoon (between 1 P.M. and 4 P.M.) and evening (between 6 P.M. and 8 P.M.) had greater flexibility and range of motion than those who stretched in the morning, between 7 A.M. and 9 A.M.. While the sample size is small, the results may indicate that stretching later in the day is optimal.\nShould I Stretch Before or After Working Out?\nWhile you may consider stretching a primer for the body pre-workout, the opposite tends to be true. According to a 2021 study published in Frontiers, stretching is more beneficial when it comes after gentle movement (think 5 to 10 minutes of walking) or even a full workout.\nWhat Types of Stretching Should You Be Doing?\n“There is no magic technique or better way to stretch,” says physical therapist Joe LaVacca. “Practice yoga, Pilates, or just some good old-fashioned strength training. The key is finding things that you can do consistently, comfortably, and with some level of joy.”\nIn addition to enjoyment, specific goals and measuring your progress can help you stay committed to your stretching regimen—and whatever routine you can commit to is the best one for you. “Action comes before motivation, so if you know what you are working toward and why you are doing it, the progress will serve as the motivation to continue,” says LaVacca.\nShould You Stretch More (or Differently) If You Sit at a Desk All Day?\nHow you spend your days affects how you should move your body. If you’re tapping away on your laptop more often than not, a day without stretching likely results in hunched, tight shoulders and tightness in the hip flexors, along with a general lack of energy. In this instance, you may want to prioritize stretch sessions that target your psoas (a muscle that starts in your lower back and ends at your upper thigh), hamstrings, and chest. In contrast, a day of standing may mean stretching your back, quads, and calves.\nEven ten minutes of morning movement coupled with short breaks for stretching (as a rule of thumb, physical therapists recommend doing some stretches every 20 minutes) can help keep your limbs loose and your mind focused.\nPer LaVacca, avoiding stagnancy is your overarching goal. “Ultimately, consistent movement is the biggest key to having freedom of movement, regardless of where you find yourself from 9 to 5 and beyond,” he says.\nHow to Determine the Best Time to Stretch for You\n“If you find yourself to be an early riser with time to spare before obligations take over, then stretching in the morning can be great,” says LaVacca. “If you find it easier to establish a routine in the evening after work, or before bed, then that will work, too.”\nIf you’re particularly busy, LaVacca recommends practicing one to two stretches whenever and wherever you find a moment. “In most cases, working 30 to 90 seconds of movement a few times a day is enough to see improvement over the course of several weeks or months,” he says.\nOne review found that stretching for at least five minutes each day, five days a week, improved the range of motion in the joints. Rather than focusing so much on the time you choose to stretch, it&#8217;s better to squeeze in small stretching sessions whenever you can. If you aim to increase flexibility and mobility, interspersing your entire day with intentional attention is likely your best bet.\nWant more Outside health stories? Sign up for the Bodywork newsletter.

    "item_subtitle": "Creatine can cause weight gain, but its performance impact is starting to prove too tempting for a sport that's rethinking w/kg.",
    "body_content": "Why are scrawny WorldTour pros tapping into creatine, a supplement once reserved for “gym bros?&#8221;\nPure and simple – for the gainz.\nSkinny Tour de France climbers, strapping cobblestone-bashers, and riders of all sizes in between are learning to overlook worries of &#8220;creatine bloat.&#8221;\nThe fast-twitch power-up of the product is just too tempting for a sport that&#8217;s shifting its view on watts per kilo.\n&#8220;A lot of riders used to see creatine as a bodybuilder, &#8216;gym guy,&#8217; supplement because it was mostly used by strength athletes or sprinters,&#8221; said Lidl-Trek nutritionist Stephanie Scheirlynck. &#8220;Bike racers always used to stay away.\n&#8220;However, many of our riders are now taking it, and the number is increasing. I think all riders will use it eventually, when the perception changes,&#8221; Scheirlynck told Velo.\nAs Scheirlynck says, the endurance community is divided over the cost-benefit of creatine.\nBut the narrative is undoubtedly starting to shift on one of the few proven “game changers” of performance.\nA new craze for creatine: &#8216;A no-brainer to use it&#8217;\nClassics specialists, sprinters, and climbers at Uno-X are all dipping in to creatine. (Photo: Tim de Waele/Getty Images)\nWhy the change?\nPumping up power is becoming as much a priority as cutting kilos in the post-pandemic peloton.\n“It&#8217;s probably one of the most well-researched and safest nutritional supplements out there. The strength benefits are well proven and can be significant,&#8221; Team Uno-X Mobility nutrition chief James Moran told Velo.\n“It can also help with cognitive fatigue and brain health. For me, it&#8217;s a no-brainer for riders to use it,&#8221; Moran said.\n&#8220;But not everybody sees it that way. A lot of people get fixated on possible weight gain.&#8221;\nMoran estimated that close to half his riders at Uno-X use creatine.\nAnd it&#8217;s not only the Scandis. The supplement is becoming a year-long intervention for many more across the top of the sport.\nBeyond that, creatine has captured the attention of biohackers, wellness gurus, and national dailies just as much as it has powerlifters and track sprinters.\n&#8220;Creatine&#8221; and &#8220;creatine monohydrate&#8221; are top #tags in this Gen-Z social era.\nExplosive strength, with some bloat\nCreatine is moving out of the gym and into pro cycling. (Photo: Christoph Soeder/picture alliance via Getty Images)\nSo what actually is this substance once hailed a &#8220;miracle&#8221; fuel?\nCreatine is a natural compound made in micro amounts by the liver, kidneys, and pancreas. It helps produce ATP, the primary energy source for muscle contraction.\nA creatine overload supercharges the body’s capacity for high-intensity output – whether that’s a 10-second velodrome sprint or a one-rep max squat.\nBut sadly our internal creatine factories aren’t productive enough to promote performance enhancement. And while creatine is also found in fish and meat, not even a daily T-bone will be enough to get you swoll.\nThat’s why creatine pills and powders are up there with whey protein and beta alanine as a staple of the strength athlete population, and have been for decades.\nA daily dose of creatine saturates the muscles and translates to the plates on the barbell. Better still, it&#8217;s easy to access, easy to take, and WADA-approved.\nBut here’s the thing.\n“Creatine bloat” has put the fear into elites competing in weight-governed sports like cycling, running, climbing, and gymnastics. The muscles can retain anywhere between a few grams and multiple pounds of water when supplementing.\nThat’s why endurance athletes have – until recently – stayed away.\nThe strength gains couldn’t be squared with the consequence on the bathroom scales.\nNo consensus from the science\nThe performance benefits of creatine are as well-proven as those of caffeine – but the science for weight-governed athletes is still unclear.  (Photo: Gruber Images )\nThe science on creatine for endurance athletes hasn&#8217;t been decisive enough to change minds, either.\nOne paper from 2024 found no benefits for recovery, body composition, or performance in a sample population of U23 pro cyclists.\nAnother recent endurance-focused study sat on the fence.\nThe research concluded that “creatine supplementation appears to be effective at improving performances that require multiple surges in intensity and/or during end spurts, which are often key race-defining moments.”\nBut it also highlighted that “creatine supplementation increases body mass, which may offset the potential positive effects, particularly in weight-bearing activities.”\n&#8216;How we think about creatine has changed a lot&#8217;\nCreatine was once reserved for classics specialists and sprinters. Now, the climbers are getting in on the action. (Photo: Gruber Images)\nAll this meant that creatine was – until recently – relatively scarce in the racing peloton.\nStage-racers and climbers might have tolerated the bloat during off-season to benefit their winter strength program. They would then cycle off and shed the retained water before race-day 1.\nMeanwhile, some sprinters and classics racers might have crushed the creatine all year. Nobody cares about a few extra pounds when they’re pummeling the pavé of Paris-Roubaix.\nBut the post-pandemic peloton has progressed fast.\nFor many, creatine is as much of a daily ritual as the pre-ride espresso.\n“How we think about creatine has changed a lot in the long time I’ve been in cycling,” Lidl-Trek’s Scheirlynck said.\n“Now that riders are strength training all year and not just over the winter, more riders are seeing the benefit of using it in the season. And we know it can help them with strength and concentration on the bike, too.&#8221;\nScheirlynck explained how revised approaches to “creatine loading” and daily diet can help riders mitigate the much-feared &#8220;bloat.&#8221;\n“Riders still worry creatine will make them gain weight. But we’re learning that if you approach creatine and overall nutrition the right way, it won’t even happen,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And we’re educating our riders in that.”\nNot all weight is created equal\nRacing is becoming about big power as much as low weight. (Photo: Gruber Images)\nLike Scheirlynck said, nutritional and training philosophies have evolved.\nThe 2025 Tour de France is a different sport from when Chris Froome beat Nairo Quintana and Alejandro Valverde in 2015.\nRiders eat twice as much on the bike, attack 100km earlier, and blast new climbing records every passing summer.\nAnd that’s informing the thinking about creatine.\nPro cycling in 2025 is a power sport rather than a weight-loss contest.\n“We keep some riders on creatine all year round, maybe more than we would have before,&#8221; Moran said. &#8220;Other riders phase it in and out.\n&#8220;We’re finding that the increase in power and strength outstrips any small increases in fluid retention that some riders see.”\nNot all weight is equal, after all.\nWhile some &#8220;creatine weight&#8221; is water, a significant proportion should be muscle.\n“Performance is not purely about total weight, but what that might be made up of. If that mass is able to produce high power at the end of four hours of racing, then it&#8217;s functional,&#8221; Moran said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just carrying a rock in your back pocket.”\nShould all riders use creatine? &#8216;It depends&#8217;\nNutritionists believe riders in need of a power boost will most benefit from creatine, but the weight offset remains problematic. (Photo: Gruber Images)\nSo should every rider – whether they’re 55kg climber Matthew Riccitello or 75kg watt-monster Wout van Aert – be chewing down creatine?\nTim Podlogar is one of the few pro team nutritionists who’s largely skeptical.\nPodlogar worked with Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe and is now consulting for Tudor Pro Cycling. He reminded that while cycling is becoming a power sport, it’s still defined by gravity.\nWeight control will always be a key area where marginal gains can be made or lost.\n“When thinking about creatine, it depends on what the limiting factor for performance is,” Podlogar told Velo.\n“If strength is negatively affecting a rider’s performance, then this is a good rationale to use it. But taking it for the sake of getting something that is not a limiting factor … well, it could just work as a placebo.”\nPodlogar joined Moran in highlighting that the most waifish climbers and the peloton&#8217;s cohort of teenage phenoms are certain candidates for creatine.\nOthers? For Podlogar, it depends.\n“I’d consider it for sprinters, but would be very hesitant for other riders,&#8221; Podlogar said. &#8220;Perhaps for riders with underdeveloped muscle mass I would consider it as well.”\nMoving from the weight room to the mainstream\nMany experts believe its only a matter of time before all endurance athletes – and maybe the general population – will be supplementing creatine. (Photo: Gruber Images)\nCreatine is moving toward the cycling mainstream. Likewise, triathletes, ultramarathoners, and climbers are curious.\nBut it clearly remains divisive.\nCreatine advocates Moran and Scheirlynck are convinced that it’s only a matter of time before the skeptics change their minds.\n“I think it&#8217;s one of those supplements that in my lifetime, will be recommended on a population level, like vitamin D,&#8221; Moran said. &#8220;There are benefits for athletes and huge potential for the general population.\n&#8220;There’s a lot of research linking dementia and brain health and maintenance of muscle mass as we age, for example.”\nWill pro cycling decide the benefits outweigh the bloat?\nCheck back in a few years&#8217; time.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nA post shared by BrainMD Health (@brainmdhealth)",

    "body_content": "Two backpackers were saved in dramatic fashion from a steep, icy cliff face in the California Sierra Nevada mountains, just north of Yosemite National Park. Emergency teams rescued the duo—who were not carrying a satellite messenger or an emergency beacon—after one of the hikers found a single bar of cell reception and called for help.\nThe incident occurred on the afternoon of  October 7, atop Burro Lake Pass east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, the Mono County Sheriff Search and Rescue Team said on Facebook. Authorities did not release the names of the two hikers.\n\nA member of the responding rescue team told Outside that the two men were prepared for a casual day hike they had planned, but woefully unequipped for the trail they followed.\n“These two guys in their twenties had been backpacking for a couple of nights out at Burro Lake,” Mono County Search and Rescue’s Mitchell Quiring told Outside.\nReturning from an alpine lake, the pair took a different route from their hike in, ascending and descending the 11,300-foot Burro Lake Pass. After straying from their intended path, the duo became stranded after attempting to descend an extremely steep alpine couloir without climbing equipment.\n\n“Instead of going up and over a completely clear shale and dirt pass, they ended up on top of this steep couloir, full of snow and ice,” Quiring explained.\nDespite traveling without crampons, ice axes, ropes, helmets, and other technical equipment, the men did not turn back, and one attempted to pick his way down the narrow, 50-degree couloir, choked with ice and loose rock. One stranded himself on a snow ledge roughly 100 feet below the ridge crest, with another 800 feet of exposure below. He was unable to descend, but was also unable to climb back up to his partner.\n\n“They didn&#8217;t have a satellite device, but one of them had one small bar of service on his phone, just enough to call for help,” Quiring said, adding that the reception on the call was so poor that the dispatchers weren’t able to communicate at length. “We tried calling, we tried texting, and the dispatchers were trying to get more information from them. But in the end, all we got was an initial: ‘I need help, I’m cliffed out.’”\nBy the time rescuers were deployed by helicopter to the pass and made contact with the stranded climber and his partner, they determined that any fall would be fatal.\n“Had somebody slipped there and not been able to arrest their fall, it would have been a body recovery, not a rescue,” Quiring said.\nWhat followed was a lengthy operation involving a dozen rescuers. Six, including Quiring, were operating from the top of the couloir, and six from below. The team employed a significant technical rigging system, first to drill into the rock to place anchors, and then to lower a rescuer down to the stranded climber from above and hoist him up to the top of the couloir, before assisting him into the waiting helicopter.\nBoth hikers were safely evacuated before sunset, and the operation concluded six hours after the initial emergency call. Both individuals experienced significant exposure to the elements, but denied further medical treatment.\nHope for the Best, Plan for the Worst\nQuiring said the two hikers were adequately equipped for the casual hiking they had planned—had they stuck to the correct route—but were woefully underprepared for the technical terrain they encountered.\n“They had no head protection, no harnesses, no bail cord, and no knowledge of how to conduct themselves in that kind of terrain,” he said.\nProper navigational equipment could have prevented the entire ordeal. Had the men been carrying even a paper map and familiarized themselves with their route beforehand, they likely could have avoided the situation.\nWhat did the two men do right? Once they were in a dangerous situation, they called for rescue immediately before the situation worsened.\n“They didn’t wait until nightfall; they didn’t waste time. The minute they knew they were in trouble, they called for help,&#8221; said Quiring, adding that the two were lucky. “It was a rare, windless Sierra day. The weather was incredibly compliant for rescue. If this had happened the day before, or the day after, the helicopter might not have been able to fly.”\nThe men were also fortunate enough to find a sliver of cell reception. Without an emergency SOS device or regular reception in the area, the pair may have had to resort to yelling (or blowing a whistle) to be heard.\nThere are a few lessons all backcountry travelers can take away from the incident.\n“Have an understanding of where you’re going in the backcountry. Research your route thoroughly beforehand, and don&#8217;t enter terrain you&#8217;re not prepared for. Finally, plan for the unexpected. Carry a two-way satellite device. Give yourself the ability to call for help,&#8221; said Quiring.",

    "item_subtitle": "A local's guide to the best of Telluride.",
    "body_content": "My first memory of skiing in Telluride goes back to elementary school. I lived about an hour from the resort and every Saturday, we’d pile onto the school bus in full ski gear — snowpants on, boots in hand, PB&amp;J sandwiches stashed in packs — and make our way to what we claimed to be “our backyard.”\nBut I didn’t get the full Telluride experience until I moved to town 20 years later. After spending years battling traffic to the ski areas surrounding Denver, I saw right away what made Telluride special: A ski town you can literally ski into. A place where the only traffic jam you’ll encounter is at the gondola after après. A ski area where lift lines are practically nonexistent.\nDowntown Telluride&#8217;s lights are second only to the apenglow behind. (Photo: Getty Images)\nWhy? Because Telluride is just far enough off the beaten path to keep the crowds away.\n“It&#8217;s more of a destination. We don’t really get weekend traffic, people come for a week at a time,” said Jess Lyles, who has lived in Telluride for 19 years and worked with the Telluride Ski Patrol for 14 years.\nThe fact that visitors come for a week, rather than a day or a weekend, like at most other resorts, changes the entire rhythm of the mountain. No one is passing through; they’re here because they want to be.\nAnd then there’s the skiing. Telluride Ski Resort is known for its expert terrain, but even intermediate skiers can get above 12,000 feet on the mountain before taking a blue run back to the base. It’s one of the few ski areas where high-alpine access doesn’t require expert skiing.\nIf you’re heading to Telluride for the first time, here’s the ultimate guide from someone who was born and raised skiing the mountain (and still does today).\nThe Mountain:\nTelluride Ski Resort has 149 trails and 19 lifts that provide access to over 2,000 acres of skiable terrain. It has the biggest vertical drop in the state, at 4,425 feet, when you include hike-to terrain — a statistic that basically means one thing: Telluride is steep.\n(Photo: Courtesy of Telluride Ski Resort)\n“Telluride really draws a high level of skier because we have some really steep, big, long runs. And then we have really amazing hike-to terrain. Palmyra Peak really separates Telluride from other ski areas,” said Lyles. “People come specifically to ski Palmyra and experience that big-mountain, backcountry feel with it still being in-bounds and patrolled. I’d say Palmyra is really the crown jewel of the ski area.”\nHiking Palmyra, which tops out at 13,319 feet, may be a bucket-list item for expert skiers, but even beginner skiers can get up to the top of Prospect Bowl, which sprawls below the Palmyra, and continue down Galloping Goose, a 4.6-mile double-green run (the resort’s longest).\nMore My First Time: Alta\nThe views also deserve a mention. The mountains surrounding Telluride are up close and in-your-face. You’re not in the foothills, you’re truly in the mountains.\nAnd then there are the views, which are cinematic and impossible to ignore. Compared to most other ski areas I’ve skied, the mountain views from Telluride Ski Resort are up close and in-your-face. You’re not in the foothills, you’re truly in the mountains.\nThe Snow: \nIn my 30-plus years of skiing in Telluride, I don’t think I’ve ever once experienced the heavy, concrete-like snow found in wetter climates. The snow in Telluride, and much of Colorado, is light and fluffy. There’s a reason why Steamboat coined the term “Champagne Powder,” and the moniker applies to Telluride, too.\n“Unique to Telluride and the Southwest is this really low-water-content, light snow,” said Lyles. “A smaller amount of snow, like four to six inches, can feel like a lot more because it&#8217;s so light.”\nHer favorite time to ski Telluride is in February: “The days are a bit longer and it tends to be a good snow month, but it’s still cold enough to keep the quality of the snow. February seems to be historically the time when we get the most snow, and we&#8217;re really dealing with good, cold winter snow.”\nThe Town:\nAt the two base areas of Telluride Ski Resort are two distinct sister towns — and they’re both ski-in, ski-out.\nIn the valley, there’s Telluride proper: a former Victorian mining town turned postcard-perfect ski town with a Main Street that’s lined with historic landmarks and colorful homes. Up above, on the mountain, is Mountain Village, a European-style ski village that was developed as a base camp for the mountain.\nTelluride Proper (left) and Mountain Village (Photo: Ryan Bonnea/ Visit Telluride)\nThe two towns are both compact and walkable, and connected by a free, 12-minute gondola.  When I lived in Telluride and worked in Mountain Village, the gondola was my twice-daily commute.\nYes, both towns are growing — a Four Seasons just broke ground in Mountain Village — but there’s still a funky feel to the area. A mushroom festival takes over the town every August, and the Free Box — a community swap spot dating back to the 1970s — recently got a permanent new home. You’ll find plenty of high-end eateries and hip speakeasies, but Telluride is still in its Patagonia era — no Gucci or Dior yet.\nGetting There:\nThe closest airport is Telluride Regional Airport (TEX), which is 10 minutes from the slopes and has daily service from Phoenix (PHX) and Denver (DEN). However, most travelers fly into Montrose Regional Airport (MTJ), which offers nonstop service from 13 major hubs across the country and is 90 minutes from Telluride. From Montrose, most people book a shuttle to Telluride, see here or here.\nFlying with skis and wish there was a better option? Read This!\nFrom Montrose, most people book a shuttle, see here or here. Montrose has a robust flight schedule that includes nonstop winter flights from New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta, San Francisco, Denver, Nashville, Houston, Austin, and Dallas.\nA pilot&#8217;s view flying into Telluride Regional Airport  (Photo: Brett Schreckengost/ Visit Telluride)\nYou can also fly to Denver (6 hours by car), Albuquerque (5.5 hours), or Salt Lake City (over 6 hours) and make the drive to Telluride via rental car.\nWhere To Stay:\nIn Telluride, Lyles recommends Camel&#8217;s Garden Hotel for its ski-in, ski-out access to the base of Lift 8 and hot après spot, Oak (more on that below). She also points to the newly renovated Victorian Inn, which is about a block from Lift 8.\nIf you want to be in the heart of the action, in a restored building that dates back to 1895, she suggests the New Sheridan Hotel. “People love staying there because of the history, and it&#8217;s really nice and has a great restaurant and bar,” she adds.\nThe New Sheridan is a popular spot for those who love history and skiing (which, as it turns out, is a lot of us). (Photo: Courtesy of Visit Telluride)\nThe hotels in Mountain Village have a more luxe, full resort feel — with swimming pools, spas, and ski valet. The Madeline Hotel &amp; Residences, which is a member of the Auberge Collection, is a great option — and is known for its heated outdoor pool beneath a ski lift and ice skating rink — while the Fairmont Heritage Place &#8211; Franz Klammer Lodge is a great option for those looking for full kitchens and spacious bedrooms (plus, complimentary airport transfers from Montrose and Telluride airports).\nAnother good option in Mountain Village is The Peaks Resort &amp; Spa, which Lyles notes “has all the bells and whistles with a spa and a pool; ski-in, ski-out; and beautiful sunsets.”\nWhere To Eat:\nThere are six on-mountain restaurants, including Gorrono Ranch, an easy favorite for a traditional ski lunch of chili, burgers, and nachos. But where Telluride really shines is when it comes to high-end, on-mountain dining.\nAllred&#8217;s serves upscale eats with an impossible not to love backdrop. (Photo: Courtesy of Telluride Ski Resort)\nAt Bon Vivant, an outdoor French eatery, you’ll dine with views of Palmyra Peak, while Lyles recommends Alpino Vino, a tiny Italian eatery that is one of the highest elevation restaurants in North America. In addition to serving a high-end on-mountain lunch, Alpino Vino welcomes guests who travel by snowcat for its renowned four-course, prix-fixe menu.\nDown in Telluride, Lyles says her favorite restaurant is The National. She notes that “They’re doing really good food there and are hosting an awesome oyster happy hour.” For breakfast, she recommends the Coffee Cowboy cart at the Telluride base of the gondola for grab-and-go, adding that, “If you want a fancier breakfast, I would definitely recommend the New Sheridan or The Butcher &amp; The Baker.”\nWhere to Après:\nThere are plenty of places to grab a post-ski drink in Telluride — including three breweries and a distillery — but there are certain spots the locals seem to gravitate to.\nGorrono Ranch is a favorite on-mountain spot. Lyles said, “Gorrono is a great place with views of the Wilsons, and the saloon always has a roaring fire. It’s a great place to get a drink.”\n\nWhile not always known for a big party scene, Telluride has no shortage of places for a post-ski drink (Photo: Courtesy of Visit Telluride)\n\nIn Telluride, at the base of Lift 8, locals tend to gather at Oak, which is located inside the Camel’s Garden Hotel, and has indoor-outdoor seating and great BBQ.\nThat all said, Lyles notes that the après scene in Telluride is somewhat lacking. After spending a winter in the French Alps, she was inspired to start Party Soldiers Productions, which hosts European-inspired après events and offers services like bartending and DJing.\nSidequests:\nIf you didn’t get enough at the ski resort, Lyles recommends checking out Helitrax, one of Colorado’s first helicopter-accessed guided backcountry ski operations.\n“It’s really an amazing way to see the mountains around Telluride. You get to ski them, but even just the act of flying in a helicopter and getting to see everything from above is really special,” said Lyles.\nShe adds that there are some great backcountry touring companies as well, pointing to the Bear Creek terrain as unique because you can access it from the ski area. Lyles, a longtime patroller, notes that Bear Creek is not controlled and is out-of-bounds terrain. You really need to have a strong understanding of that area of the mountain and snowpack to ski back there, but it&#8217;s really unique to have access to that kind of terrain right out of the ski area.”",

    "body_content": "When it comes to the shoes that ruled the 2025 Chicago Marathon, the story was one of longevity versus novelty. On one end, the Nike Alphafly 3, now two years old, proved its staying power with Jacob Kiplimo’s commanding 2:02:23 victory and Conner Mantz’s new American record.\nOn the other, Puma’s Fast-R Nitro Elite 3, the most aggressively styled and innovative super-shoe on the market, broke through with personal bests and top-10 finishes across the women’s field.\nChicago became the meeting point of two design eras: the veteran still defining the standard, and the upstart rewriting the rules. The result wasn’t a passing of the torch, but a dead heat between the old guard and the new wave—a rare equilibrium in the super-shoe arms race.\nBelow, we break down the fastest shoes at the 2025 Chicago Marathon, and what this balance between legacy and innovation says about where the super shoe arms race stands today.\nJacob Kiplimo, Conner Mantz, and the Enduring Reign of the Alphafly 3\nJacob Kiplimo from Uganda won the Chicago Marathon in the Nike Alphafly 3. He was among five of the top 10 athletes in the men&#8217;s race to wear the shoes. (Photo: Bank of America Chicago Marathon/Kevin Morris)\nHeading into the 2025 Chicago Marathon, all eyes were on John Korir—the defending champion and reigning Boston Marathon winner—who had boldly announced plans to chase a sub-2:01 finish. But Jacob Kiplimo from Uganda, the 24-year-old half-marathon world-record holder (56:42), proved that his world-class talent extends well beyond the 13.1-mile distance.\nKiplimo took risks. While no runner plans to positive-split a marathon, his decision to press the pace early effectively disrupted Korir’s rhythm. He crossed the halfway mark in 1:00:16, putting him on pace for the late Kelvin Kiptum’s 2:00:35 world record set at Chicago in 2023. Near the 35km mark, Korir dropped out, and Kiplimo surged ahead uncontested, breaking the tape in 2:02:23, 91 seconds clear of Amos Kipruto (KEN, 2:03:54).\nIt wasn’t just a statement win for Kiplimo—it was another major victory for the Nike Alphafly 3, the same shoe that has dominated marathon podiums for more than two years and was worn by Kiptum during his aforementioned world record.\nKiplimo wasn’t the only Nike athlete making moves on the men’s leaderboard. Mantz, wearing the latest dev model of the Alphafly 3 (Nike Dev 16141), set a new American record that surpassed Khalid Khannouchi’s long-standing mark of 2:05:38, finishing in 2:04:43 and fourth overall. That matches his fourth-place finish in Boston earlier this year and underscores his dominance among Americans in the marathon distance.\nConner Mantz set a new American record at the Chicago marathon wearing Nike Alphafly 3. (Photo: Getty Images)\nAll told, five of the top-10 men crossed the Chicago finish line in Alphafly 3s—including Huseydin Mohamed Esa (ETH, 2:04:50), Seifu Tura (ETH, 2:05:17), and Geoffrey Kamworor (KEN, 2:05:31)—further proof that even two years after launch, Nike’s flagship marathon racer remains the benchmark for performance.\nThe Alphafly is no longer the lightest super-shoe on the market—that title now belongs to Asics’s new Metaspeed Ray—but its blend of propulsive foam, signature Zoom Air pods, and optimum stability often matter more than weighing a few less grams on the scale, and continues to make it one of the most trusted tools in elite racing (and favorite of many citizen marathoners too).\nHawi Feysa and the Growing Legacy of the Adios Pro Evo Series\nHawi Feysa of Ethiopia broke away after the halfway mark and never looked back, winning in the Adidas Adizero Adios Pro Evo 2 with a time of 2:14:56—delivering yet another major-marathon victory for Adidas’s Evo series, the ultra-minimal racer that also helped Tigst Assefa (ETH, 2:11:53) smash her own world record at this year’s London Marathon.\nFeysa—who, like Kiplimo, is just 24—secured a win that further cements Adidas’s role as a first-place contender in the marathon shoe wars, continuing to innovate at “Lightstrike” speed. Weighing just 138 grams (4.9 ounces), with a stiff carbon platform and aggressive rocker geometry, the Evo 2 stands as the second-lightest elite marathon shoe currently on the market—roughly 10g heavier than the recently debuted Asics Metaspeed Ray (129 g/4.5 oz).\nWhile Adidas claimed the crown, Nike, Asics, and Puma filled out the women’s leaderboard. Runner-up Megertu Alemu (ETH, 2:17:18) likely raced in Nike’s Vaporfly 4, while Loice Chemnung (KEN, 2:18:23) and Magdalena Shauri (TAN, 2:18:03) delivered podium-level performances for Asics, wearing the Metaspeed Ray and Metaspeed Sky Tokyo, respectively.\nAnd just as in the men’s field, Nike’s Alphafly 3 continued to make its presence known—under the feet of Mary Ngugi-Cooper (KEN, 2:19:25), Florencia Borelli (ARG, 2:24:23), and Gabriella Rooker (USA, 2:26:32)—proving that two years after its launch, the shoe remains a defining force across both sides of the elite podium.\nPuma’s Fast-R Nitro Elite 3 Makes An Even Bigger Splash\nFollowing its heavily promoted—but somewhat underwhelming—debut at this year’s Boston Marathon, the Puma Fast-R Nitro Elite 3 made a strong statement in Chicago, emerging as the second-most-popular shoe among the women’s top 10.\nThree athletes—Natosha Rogers (USA, 2:23:28) (top American finisher), Dakotah Popehn (USA, 2:24:21) (second American), and Melody Julien (FRA, 2:27:09)—all ran personal bests in the model, helping solidify Puma’s reemergence as a serious player in elite racing.\nDakotah Popehn ran a personal best wearing Puma Fast-R Nitro Elite 3. (Photo: Getty Images)\nPuma’s lightweight, split-midsole design—with its ultra-soft-and-responsive A-TPU Nitro Elite foam and rigid carbon bridge—has officially moved beyond novelty status. With such a deep field choosing to lace up in it, the Fast-R Nitro Elite 3 cements Puma’s reputation as the comeback brand of the 2020s—a company once known for its sprinting heritage now carving out space in the marathon super-shoe conversation.\nThe Other Super-Shoes in the Top 10\nWith Nike’s Alphafly 3 and Adidas’s Adios Pro Evo 2 taking the wins and Puma taking up more space on the leaderboard, three other shoes made major statements in Chicago—each showcasing how diverse the marathon footwear landscape continues to become.\nThe Asics Metaspeed Trifecta: Ray, Sky Tokyo &amp; Edge Tokyo\nApparently, one marathon super shoe wasn’t enough for Asics. Their current top-tier lineup has three different models. Loice Chemnung (KEN, 2:18:23) raced in the Metaspeed Ray, a featherweight design that now stands as the lightest in the field at 129 grams (4.5 ounces). And defending Chicago champ John Korir was aiming for an audacious sub-2:01 before he DNF’d, and chose to race in the Metaspeed Ray to help him get there.\nMeanwhile, Magdalena Shauri (TAN, 2:18:03) impressed in the Metaspeed Sky Tokyo, while Bashir Abdi (BEL, 2:07:08) represented the Metaspeed Edge Tokyo, both using Asics’s dual-foam system (FF Turbo + FF Leap) and full-length carbon plate to deliver a smooth, energetic ride.\nAll three Metaspeed models share a 39.5 mm heel/34.5 mm forefoot stack and a 5 mm drop, but they’re tuned for different stride mechanics: the Ray for maximal energy return for forefoot runners, the Edge for higher cadence, and the Sky for maximal stride length. Together, they signal that Asics is no longer chasing the leaders—it’s running stride-for-stride with them.\nHoka Cielo X1 3.0\nIn one of the day’s biggest surprises, Alex Masai (KEN, 2:04:37) placed third wearing an unreleased prototype of Hoka’s Cielo X1 3.0. It is rumored to be slightly lower-stacked and lighter than its predecessor, and to refine Hoka’s signature rocker geometry with a stiffer carbon plate and more aggressive toe spring. While not yet available to the public, the Cielo X1 3.0’s debut on the Chicago podium cements Hoka’s return to the front of the super-shoe conversation.\nOn Cloudboom Strike\nAlthough it didn’t appear on the podium, the On Cloudboom Strike continues to draw attention from pros and testers alike. Weighing 210 grams (7.4 ounces) with a 39.5 mm stack and 4 mm drop, it pairs Helion HF PEBA-based foam with a full-length carbon Speedboard for a firm yet efficient ride.\nThe shoe’s Chicago appearance came courtesy of Ryan Ford (USA)—who had only just announced his new affiliation with On’s Boulder-based elite team on Saturday. His entry marked one of the first official marathon outings for On’s newest racer. Unlike the softer trend dominating other brands, the Cloudboom Strike favors responsiveness and ground feel, appealing to forefoot-striking athletes who value control and turnover over plushness.\nMen’s Results and Fastest Shoes at the 2025 Chicago Marathon",

    "body_content": "Revolutionary. Game-changing. These are the most overused words when it comes to gear and technology. But they’re the only way to describe the new Hypershell X Ultra, an AI-powered exoskeleton made specifically for outdoor adventures and endurance sports. Whether you need support to push the limits on an epic hike, ride, or climb, or simply need the assistance to help experience the outdoors, the X Ultra enables you to achieve your goals while reducing exertion, heart rate, and muscle fatigue.\nThe X Ultra is a first-of-its-kind exoskeleton made for outdoor adventure and endurance sports. (Photo: Hypershell)\nSo what is it? Exoskeleton is a word you’re more likely to see in a sci-fi movie than while shopping for trail gear, but Hypershell’s latest is far from fiction. The X Ultra is the world’s first exoskeleton specifically designed to help endurance athletes and everyday adventurers go further. The wearable device is made from aerospace-grade titanium alloy and SpiralTwill 3000 Carbon Fiber, which means, despite its minuscule weight, it’s incredibly durable and built to withstand conditions you’re likely to encounter outside (think steep scree fields or rocky singletrack). The whole thing with the battery weighs about 3 pounds, and one charge will get you up to 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) of range, or around 42,000 steps.\nThe X Ultra uses AI to adapt to your movements and reduce your physical exertion. (Photo: Hypershell)\nAs always, the proof is in the details. And these details are impressive. With 1,000 watts of peak power output, the exoskeleton reduces physical exertion by up to 39 percent while you’re cycling and 22 percent while walking. It also reduces heart rate during activity by up to 40 percent. It does all of this by using AI to adapt to your movement and assist with each step or pedal stroke—even better, it learns your gait pattern over time for a more seamless and personalized user experience.\nThe exoskeleton is lightweight and portable, making it ideal for longer excursions and training sessions.  (Photo: Hypershell)\nYou could spend all day just dreaming up ways to put the X Ultra to use. Last year, I spent six weeks bikepacking the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route and rode 2,700 miles from Mexico to Canada. Taking off six weeks for the journey was a push, and I can’t help but wonder how long it would have taken me if I had the X Ultra (or how much better my legs would’ve felt each night!).\nBut epic efforts are only one way to benefit from the X Ultra. It also makes hiking objectives feel more doable at any level, like accessing a hard-to-reach fly fishing spot or touring winter terrain. It actually adapts to a dozen different conditions and activities, snow and sand included. And with the new Downhill Buffering feature, the X Ultra detects downward motion and automatically reduces impact, helping to protect your joints.\nThe Downhill Buffering feature can be used to reduce stress on your joints when tackling big descents. (Photo: Hypershell)\nRevolutionary? That might be an understatement.\nShop Now\n\nAbout Hypershell\nFounded in 2021, Hypershell is a wearable robotics company focused on expanding human mobility. Its intelligent exoskeletons adapt in real time to terrain, activity, and intention, making movement lighter and more natural. With SGS-certified performance and more than 15,000 units sold worldwide, Hypershell enhances — not replaces — human ability, shaping a future where wearable robotics become as essential as backpacks for exploration, work, and play.",

    "body_content": "Just days after the federal government shut down, a wave of illicit activity began in Yosemite National Park. Since the beginning of October, there has been an uptick in illegal camping, unpermitted hiking, and BASE jumping within the park. \r\nHalf Dome, one of the most sought-after hikes in the park, has seen hikers taking advantage of the strained resources to score a trip up on the peak’s infamous cabled section without a permit. Recent videos and photographs show walls of people on the iron cables, likely a result of unpermitted hikers attempting the summit at the same time as those with permits. \r\nAt this time, it’s unclear how many Yosemite employees were deemed “essential” to continue operations during the government shutdown. But with significant park resources like visitor centers and information booths closing down across the country, national parkgoers are unable to access ordinarily available resources. In addition, national park websites don’t get regular updates during government shutdowns, which contributes to a lack of information to incoming visitors. \r\nThe shutdown hasn’t just brought hikers trying to sneak onto famous trails; it has also brought illegal campers, according to reporting by SFGATE. Permitted camping tends to be strictly enforced within park boundaries, but now, people are taking advantage of the limited park resources and illegally setting up camp.\r\nDue to the government shutdown straining resources, Yosemite rangers aren’t able to monitor more remote areas of the park. Although the park’s ranger shortage could reduce the likelihood of illicit campers receiving a citation, those who sidestep the rules could create dangerous conditions for other visitors and negatively impact the natural setting.\r\n“It’s like the Wild Wild West,” John DeGrazio, founder of the tour company YExplore Yosemite Adventures, told SFGATE. As an avid hiker and community member, DeGrazio said that he’s never seen the park in such straits. \r\n\r\nIn BASE jumping, one of the most dangerous extreme sports, participants jump from fixed objects, such as cliffsides, and use a parachute to reach the ground. (Photo: Krystle Wright via Getty Images)\r\n\r\nWhile hikers are sneaking onto the Half Dome cables and campers are setting up tents without permits, BASE jumpers are counting on a lack of park resources to limit citations for the illegal sport. Posts on Instagram show multiple people jumping off of El Capitan since the shutdown began. \r\nFor decades, the federal government never formally outlawed BASE jumping, but Yosemite’s law enforcement teams used federal aerial guidelines to police the phenomenon. Now, park officials are warning visitors that the sport is, in fact, illegal within national parks. \r\nThe park service’s public affairs office told Newsweek, &#8220;BASE jumping is illegal in all national parks, including Yosemite, due to the significant safety risks it poses to participants, the public, and first responders.&#8221;\r\nAcross the country, many national parkgoers are wondering whether or not they should visit unguarded parks during a government shutdown. Most resource centers are not outwardly discouraging hikers to visit national park sites, but rather notifying them that crowds and congestion are likely. Other advocates have called for the parks&#8217; closure for the duration of the shutdown. In the wake of recent illicit activities, Emily Thompson, the executive director of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks released a statement saying: &#8220;This is exactly what we warned about. And this is why national parks need to be closed until the government re-opens. This shutdown is making an already bad situation at national parks and public lands far worse. And the longer this goes, the worse it is going to get. The situation is dangerous and reckless for our parks, public lands, and the visitors who love them.&#8221;",

    "item_subtitle": "Jessica \"Stitches\" Guo finished thru-hiking the Continental Divide and Great Divide Trails in one five-month push.",
    "body_content": "Jessica “Stitches” Guo began her 30th birthday alone, in the woods, walking north towards the Canadian border.\nIt was the same way she had spent the last few months of her 20s, during which she hiked from the Mexican border through New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana along the Continental Divide Trail (CDT). This day, however, was different.\nAt 1:51 P.M. on August 12, Guo reached a clearing in the trees, where stone monuments marked the U.S.-Canada border and the northern terminus of the CDT. She collapsed into tears alongside some concerned tourists. When they learned what she had just done, they applauded and helped her record a video, which would be viewed by more than half a million people on TikTok and Instagram.\nFor a few minutes, Guo sat, welcoming her 30s with birthday-cake Oreos and taking it all in. Then, she stood and continued into Canada. Her journey was not over. In many ways, she felt as if it were just beginning.\n“Up until that point, I was like, ‘There’s a chance that I might not do this.’ I might get there and be too late, or I might be too tired, or I might be too bored,” Guo says. “So for me to get there and still be feeling great, I was like, ‘All right, yeah, we can actually start the real hike now.’”\nAfter over 2,800 miles of hiking on the CDT, Guo was now beginning her thru-hike of the 750-mile Great Divide Trail, the second phase of a linkup that only two hikers had ever completed. The somewhat obscure linkup became common knowledge to the thru-hiking internet via Guo’s daily chronicles of her journey.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nA post shared by jess \uD83C\uDF32stitches on trail (@whereisjessi.ca)\n\n\n\nEach day, Guo spoke into her phone camera: “Today is day X hiking the Continental Divide Trail and Great Divide Trail combined.” A map would pop up with a blinking pin indicating her location. Over the next minute or so, Guo shared footage of her day of hiking, accompanied by reflections on what hiking meant to her, her family, and the decisions that brought her to where she was.\n“I had never really made videos before this,” Guo says. “My feelings got more complex as I started to really have a lot of reflective time on trail. And so then it became harder and harder to try to pack it all in.”\nWhat began as an effort to document her hike for family and friends became a powerful source of inspiration for tens of thousands of new followers. Over 153 days, Guo created a video every day documenting her progress, assisted by her brother, who posted them to social media. Guo wrote her scripts and sifted through clips each night when she set up camp. During road walks and easy sections of trail, she edited on the move, cutting a video while cars, trucks, and other hikers rushed past.\n“Everybody else who was walking past me was probably like, ‘This girl is missing the whole point. She’s on her phone the whole time,’” Guo says. “I was like, ‘I’m working!’”\nDuring her five-month journey, Guo still had plenty of time alone to soak up the Rocky Mountain scenery. In contrast with her first thru-hike of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) in 2023, where she hiked with people for all but the first 10 days, this trip was strikingly solitary.\n“There was pretty much nobody,” Guo says. “There were 28 days that I saw nobody, 40 days that I saw nobody on the trail, but I saw people in town or at the road or something, and I think there were 22 days where I saw one person.”\nGuo spent long periods alone on her hike. For some 28 days of it, she didn’t see another soul (Photo: Jessica “Stitches” Guo)\nGuo set off from the Mexican border on April 21, blitzing through the heat of New Mexico to arrive at the high-elevation San Juans of southwest Colorado in mid-May, when they were still covered in snow. With a pair of newly-acquired snowshoes, Guo joined forces with Philip “Slide” Witmer, a fellow 2023 PCT hiker who is attempting a border-to-border calendar year Triple Crown.\n“It was so fun to be able to hike with somebody who also had to keep up a similar pace,” Guo says. “It was so great to just have somebody else to talk to who was also on this trail and could relate to things that I was saying. He gave me so much beta.”\nAfter scrambling ridgelines, climbing cornices with their ice axes, and navigating exposed traverses, the two made it through the San Juans relatively intact, but separated as Witmer pushed big miles and Guo recovered from anterior tibialis tendinitis, a result of dragging heavy snowshoes for hours every day. Still, Guo made it to Wyoming ahead of schedule, where she decided to take the high route across the Wind River Range.\n\nIn addition to the massive energy expenditure of this high route (“there was one day that I burned 4,000 calories in four miles”), Guo faced swarms of mosquitoes and flies at lower elevations that slowed her progress.\n“I had a lot of mosquito bites around my face and eyes, and it just swelled up a lot,” Guo says. “I ended up going to a gas station trying to get allergy medication, but all they had was Benadryl. So, I took that, but then I was so sleepy it knocked me out.”\nIn Montana, Guo got “car washed” by overgrown foliage drenched in consistent rain, and crossed into Canada to find slow going, as she bushwhacked through dense forest and loose mountainsides.\n“A lot of places on the GDT are not really a trail. It’s just a route,” Guo says. “It might just be like, clearly here’s the dirt that’s been disturbed on this steep slope.”\nAfter skirting the border of Alberta and British Columbia for another month, through muddy bogs and rocky ridgelines, under Aurora-tinted night skies, Guo reached some of her lowest mental lows as she neared her finish line.\n“The last week of a thru-hike is mentally the toughest week because I’m so close and I’m still not there and I want to be done,” Guo says. “I did a high route during that time as well. So I was like, my God, why did I put myself in this position where now I’m doing such slow miles? The trail is going to end in 100 miles, but I’m doing less than a mile an hour.”\nBut in her final days, small interactions with strangers lifted her. Two moose hunters stopped to chat with her. Two hikers gave her extra food. A pack of caribou passed through a meadow in front of her.\n“Every single one of those last couple of days, I always had something that was like, &#8216;That was actually really great,’” Guo says. “I was like, ‘Okay, no, you know what? I am meant to be out here and finishing this hike in the way that I am.’”\nAn aurora in the night sky greeted Guo during one of her final nights on the trail (Photo: Jessica “Stitches” Guo)\nGuo took one final high route alternate over Surprise Pass, a testament to how she had embraced challenges on her already monumental linkup. In a video chronicling her final day on the trail, Guo references a quote from one of her pre-trail blog posts: “I’m hiking the combined CDT and GDT because I’m truly not sure I’ll be able to, and I want to push the boundary of what I think I’m capable of. I’m hiking it because it intimidates me.”\nAt 10:40 A.M. on September 19, after 152 days, 3,550 miles, and 588,000 feet of elevation, Guo became the first woman on record to hike the combined CDT and GDT. The next day, her parents greeted her at the trailhead with smiles, tears, and hugs, as well as a trimmer her dad brought to clear some overgrowth on the road. It had taken some convincing to get their support for her adventures.\n“I said I would be the first woman, and they were like, ‘Why do you have to be the first? Clearly there’s a reason that nobody else is doing this,’” Guo says. “But by the time I got to Wyoming, they were like, ‘Yeah, you’re really doing this thing.’ They were so proud and happy to see me, which really meant a lot to me, for them to come out and support me in person and see that I could do it on my own.”\nGuo crossed back into the U.S., celebrating with her family in Washington. In the weeks since finishing, she has spent days sifting through emails, trying to decide how to best use the new opportunities associated with her platform. She hopes to give back to a hiking community that has given her so much and open the door for more hikers like her to find their purpose. Because for Guo, the trail has meant the world.\n“Through the fact that I’ve been able to spend so much time on trail, I have been able to live a really rich life,” Guo says. “And I really felt that when I was thinking about my 20s as I was approaching the end of the CDT. I was like, ‘You know what? I think I’ve lived it the right way.’”",

    "item_title": "Opinion: Suunto's Lawsuit Against Garmin Only Makes Strava Look Worse",
    "item_subtitle": "Strava is on damage control mode after filing suit against Garmin and outraging users.",
    "body_content": "On September 22, Suunto filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Garmin covering five patents related to “tracking golf shots, measuring a user’s respiratory rate, and positioning antennas and antenna assemblies inside a watch.”What’s interesting about that news is just how boring it is.\nIt happened eight days before Strava filed suit against Garmin for patent infringement and no one noticed. Even now as articles come out covering the fact that it happened, each one ties the two lawsuits together with only very minimal information about the Suunto complaint.\nThis is how a patent battle generally takes place. Suunto hasn’t requested that Garmin stop shipping units and is only seeking damages. There’s no lengthy Reddit post explaining why the suit was filed and it appears to be a straightforward assertion of patent rights. A court will decide, or a settlement will happen that finds a reasonable path forward for both companies. From a user perspective, you’ll never think about it again.\n(Photo Josh Ross/Velo)\nStrava does things differently\nI covered the Strava-Garmin suit, in a very straightforward manner, but there’s a lot more to it. Strava is also asserting patent rights with respect to two technologies, but at its core the case isn’t really about the patents. How do I know that? Strava’s chief product officer Matt Salazar explained it in a 325-word Reddit post.\nAs you have seen, we’ve recently taken some action against Garmin. I wanted to post on here to share some background on why we did this and the situation with Garmin.\nOn July 1st, Garmin announced new developer guidelines for all of its API partners, including Strava, that required the Garmin logo to be present on every single activity post, screen, graph, image, sharing card etc. We have until November 1st to comply, and if not, Garmin has threatened to cut off access to their API, stopping all Garmin activities from being uploaded to Strava.\nWe are actively trying to prevent this from happening for two reasons:\n\nWe consider this blatant advertising. These new guidelines actively degrade your user experience on Strava (and the other 150M+ athletes). We already provide attribution for every data partner, but Garmin wants to use Strava and every other partner as an advertising platform &#8211; they told us they care more about their marketing than your user experience. Garmin doesn’t even provide data attribution for 3rd party devices (such as heart-rate monitors or power meters) on the Garmin Connect app.\nWe consider this to be YOUR data. If you recorded an activity on your watch, we think that is your data. We believe you should be able to freely transfer or upload that data without requiring logos to be displayed alongside it or have that data be used as an advertisement to sell more watches.\n\nUnfortunately we could not justify to our users complying with the new guidelines. As such, we have tried to resolve this situation with Garmin over the course of the past five months, including proposing additional attribution across the platform in a less intrusive way, but to no avail.\nWe know we have a lot of Garmin users on Strava as well as r/Strava and so wanted to be clear with everyone as to the current situation and what we’re trying to do to resolve it.\nIt&#8217;s a lot of explanation, but still doesn&#8217;t reveal why Strava is doing this. It’s not actually unheard of to use patents as part of an unrelated negotiation. In this case Strava is using a patent — which might not actually be very strong but that’s something the court will decide — to force a negotiation about showing Garmin logos on activities. Why the explanation and drama surrounding it?\nHow many Garmin devices do you have and would you buy a Strava device if one was available? (Photo Josh Ross/Velo)\nStrava isn’t respecting the users\nIn mid-November of last year, Strava made a sweeping change to the Strava API. The company asserted ownership of user data uploaded via, among others, Garmin devices. Of course, Strava wouldn’t characterize it quite like that. Instead, the company stated the change was “helping to ensure we continue to uphold high standards of data security and privacy for our users.” But does that ring true to you?\nBefore that change, you had the ability to verify that you wanted your data shared to third parties. Strava could be the hub, and your chosen, and verified, connections could use that data in all kinds of innovative ways. After that change — which only gave 30 days for companies to comply — you had to directly connect your head unit (i.e Garmin) to third party services and bypass Strava.\nReading what Strava is now claiming, it’s difficult to draw any other conclusion than that Strava is pretending that recent history didn’t happen — or that you don’t remember it.\n(Photo Josh Ross/Velo)\nWhy is Strava so visible on these patents?\nOkay but that history of Strava asserting ownership of your data then trying to claim it’s actually yours doesn’t actually explain things. If you want to understand the why, just scan through the comments on Salazar&#8217;s Reddit post. Strava isn’t showing the upvotes or downvotes on the post but you’d have to guess there’s a reason for that. Comments aren’t closed and they are overwhelmingly negative. Users are not happy with Strava, and this isn’t new.\nFor a long time Strava was widely seen as being all about leaderboards on segments. Back in 2020 that feature got moved from the free tier to the paid tier. Then the company added AI based &#8220;Athlete Intelligence&#8221; in October 2024 to widespread ridicule only to follow up with the API changes a month later that limited what users could do with their own data.\nStrava is attempting to get out in front of the story and put a positive spin on the latest news.\nGarmin offers a whole lot of fitness and analysis data for free with the purchase of a device. (Photo Josh Ross/Velo)\nIs the Strava strategy working?\nUsers in the Garmin subreddit are sharing screenshots of cancelled subscriptions and the words “Sent from my Garmin” in the description of activity uploads. On the Strava Reddit post, the top comment is “As a premium (paid) Strava member I want to be clear that Strava&#8217;s only of use to me if (it) works with Garmin. The moment Strava no longer syncs with Garmin connect is the last time I open Strava.”\nIt doesn’t seem like Strava is moving the needle much with these changes, at least not in the direction they want to move it. I know I’ve not been swayed and I don’t seem to be alone.\nLike other users, I see Strava as a social media site that focuses the conversation around fitness activities. Nothing wrong with that, but I don’t see it as a necessity. I plan my rides without Strava then I record my activities with a device, often Garmin but not always, for analysis outside of Strava.\nThere’s no Strava hardware and most cyclists aren’t using the app on a phone. That means everyone already has their data somewhere else. The API change just forced users to move Strava outside the data pipeline. Instead of going from hardware to Strava to somewhere else, now users go from hardware to everywhere simultaneously. It moved Strava from the middle of the data stream to the end, and in many situations it makes Garmin the hub.\nThen, in the face of all that, Strava is making a series of user-negative moves. Rather than developing new features users want and adding them to a compelling paid tier, the company moved popular features from free to paid. Instead of clearly stating that a change was needed with the API then working with third parties to keep them viable and give them time to make changes, Strava gave a 30-day ultimatum with no wiggle room.\nA lot of users, including myself, already see Strava as a nice to have, not a core necessity, and don’t have much goodwill remaining for the company. It seems like an odd idea to try and start from that position and ask users to support outrage over Garmin requesting attribution for data created on, and uploaded from, a Garmin device.\nPerhaps I’m wrong though? Should we all be more supportive of the Strava position? Or is it possible this is one more step in the downfall of Strava as more and more users view it as only a social network with nothing worth paying for?",

    "body_content": "I’m still trying to catch my breath and process what just happened in Kona at the women’s 2025 Ironman World Championship.\nKona always does strange things, as athletes go all in for the win. I respect this approach, but it’s something I could never do, not just because I didn’t have the talent, but I didn’t have the guts to take the hand brake off. But Kona &#8211; it breaks athletes. It strips champions down. The island takes no prisoners. It’s brutal. But at the same time, new stars rise, and records are broken.\nWe had five prior world champions (including Ironman 70.3) on the start line, and only two finished (German Laura Philipp and Brit Holly Lawrence). And for the second time in four years, a Kona rookie took the title.\nNorway was dominant in the men’s Ironman World Championship in Nice last month, taking the clean sweep of the podium. In the women’s event, there was just one professional from Norway, but she took the title.\nSolveig Løvseth, in just her third Ironman race, having moved up from the Olympic distance last year, took the lead with 3K to go, just before the crest of Palani Road. Kat Matthews (GBR) now adds a second place in Kona to her world championship tally of second places from around the world (St. George and Nice), finishing just 35 seconds behind Løvseth. Philipp, the defending 2024 champion, finished in third.\nSolveig Løvseth biked most of the Ironman World Championship course alone, pulling away from the chase group on her way to then-leaders Taylor Knibb and Lucy Charles-Barclay. Now she sits in second place in the Ironman Pro Series. (Photo: Brad Kaminski/Triathlete)\nPrior world champions struggle in the grueling Kona conditions\nThe 2022 Ironman world champion was the first to fall. Having had an incredible swim, Chelsea Sodaro (USA) struggled to keep fluid down on the bike and by mile 49 was sitting on the side of the road.\nIt took until mile 17 on the run for the 2023 Ironman world champion, Lucy Charles-Barclay, to step off the road, her day over, clearly struggling to hold a straight line, affected by the heat, effort, and conditions.\nThe three-time Ironman 70.3 world champion, Taylor Knibb (USA), then looked destined for this to be her day. After overtaking Charles-Barclay around mile 12/13 out on the Queen K, it looked like the title was hers. Running back into town, Knibb looked great &#8211; before she didn’t with just 3K to go, and the lights went out. Stumbling, staggering, and sitting on the side of the road, “I’m done,” she exclaimed.\nIn the space of 7 miles, the race had been blown apart, and now Løvseth was in the lead. But it wasn’t over yet. Matthews, who had started the run 14 minutes down from the lead, was running like a train and suddenly closing down on Løvseth. How much more drama could we take? It was going to be touch and go. In the end, 35 seconds separated Løvseth and Matthews. One of the closest and most dramatic races we have seen in a long time!\nBut the drama continues …\nWhat could happen in the Ironman Pro Series with one race left?\nWhile the ladies were certainly chasing the world title, valuable points for the Ironman Pro Series were also on the line. Leading into Kona, Matthews had a pretty commanding lead in the series and looked to be pretty sure to take the series in 2025, as she had in 2024. Matthews needed to beat Løvseth by 65 seconds to secure the title. Obviously, that did not happen.\nSo, where does that leave the Ironman Pro Series, with just one race left, the Ironman 70.3 World Championship in Marbella, in November?\nWomen&#8217;s Ironman Pro Series standings as of October 13, 2025",

My mind slowed down and I could observe the reality of where I was without the overwhelming fear. That moment of perspective helped me reconnect with the sensation of being in my body, and the rhythmic movement of swimming. I was able to lengthen my exhalations and my body responded by slowing my breathing. That allowed me to keep going and I thought, “Maybe I can do this.”\nThat was the exact thought that had led me to sign up for my first sprint triathlon at the age of 58—and landed me in this moment.\nStarting Slowly\nI never considered myself athletic. The most exercise I had practiced was gentle asana (yoga postures) for the last 35 years. My focus has always been more on the subtle practices of pranayama (breathwork), meditation, and yoga philosophy.\nMy interest in exercise started innocently enough a few years ago with beach walks. Each morning, I noticed a man who was considerably older than me, probably in his early 80s, jogging the entire length of the beach. I was impressed. The mere idea of running scared me, as I’d had my share of back issues and believed I was too old to push myself like that. But his grit inspired me. I recall thinking, “Maybe I could do that?”\nMy walks slowly turned into hesitant jogs. My body protested at first, although the sensations from running felt like exploring a new asana, which intrigued me. Even when I became sore, I felt a new strength that I had either never experienced or forgotten.\nRunning also felt like an extension of my breathwork practice. When I was running, I was so aware of my breath and how my body was constantly trying to deepen it. It felt like my body was practicing pranayama instinctively based on its need for more oxygen.\nAround the same time, I started biking more. Eventually, I got rid of my car as it would support my physical wellness and support the environment. I also added weightlifting to my everyday workouts based on research about how we slowly lose muscle and bone mass as we age, potentially up to two percent each year after the age of 35.\nThe Power of Maybe\nOne day last August, I happened to be on the beach as the Santa Barbara Triathlon was taking place. I watched in awe as athletes competed in the swim, bike, and run. I stood in the sand and watched the triathletes exiting the water as they completed the swim portion. What surprised me was that they looked like regular people. Like me. They didn’t look like the athletes we see in the media. They were all ages and body types, and their diversity inspired me to think, “Maybe I could do that.”\nThat “maybe” was more powerful than I realized. Over the years, yoga has shown me that my identity is mutable. I’m not simply my mind and my endless thoughts. I know I’m much more—maybe love, maybe spirit, maybe an athlete. In that moment, I realized that I was limited not only by my perceived physical ability, but by my self-image and my belief that I wasn’t an athlete. In fact, that notion may have been my most limiting factor.\nI’ve always been intrigued by the self-inquiry at the heart of Jnana Yoga, the path of wisdom and self-knowledge. This path asks us to question the beliefs that make up our identity by literally asking ourselves the question, “Who am I?” You can try a Jnana Yoga meditation yourself. Sit comfortably, take a few breaths, and repeat the question, “Who am I?” You can also ask any related questions. For example, “Am I my body?” “Am I my thoughts?” “Am I the breath?” “Where do my thoughts come from, and where do they go?” “Who am I?” Then sit for a few minutes in silence and listen for an answer or for whatever comes.\nLast June, after sitting with and questioning who I thought I was and working to overcome my fear, I took a leap of faith and signed up for a sprint triathlon, which is about half the Olympic triathlon distance. It consisted of a 500-yard open ocean swim, six-mile bike ride, and two-mile run with timed transitions in between. For a so-called short course, it still seemed daunting for a beginner like me.\nI decided that my goal was to complete the triathlon safely by approaching training and the race as a yoga practice. I also realized that although I was a little old to be launching into an endurance sport, my yoga practice would help keep me safe from injury.\nFacing My Fears\nI spent the next two months focusing on the open water swim, which was the part of the three-part race that felt most overwhelming. I’m an okay swimmer—or so I thought. But swimming in the Pacific Ocean was a different story. There was almost zero visibility under the murky water, it was usually too cold to keep my head in the water for long periods of time, there were lots of waves and random currents, and the thought of sharks sometimes gave me a slight panic.\nMy fear of sharks wasn’t unfounded. This area is known as a nursery for juvenile Great White Sharks, even though they usually ignore humans. I was told to avoid swimming alone and to stay close to shore, which didn’t make me feel much better. But I decided this was a practice of self-discipline, or tapas, and I committed to swimming in the ocean every other day.\nSwimming is also an experience of sensory deprivation or pratyahara. There is only the sound of my breath and the feeling of my body moving through the weight of the water. Sometimes during my beginner triathlon training I felt like the salt water made me buoyant and light, but most of the time I felt like the waves were trying to pull me under.\n(Photo: Courtesy Jivana Heyman)\nBreathing during swimming is also backward compared to yoga. I had to learn to inhale through my mouth and exhale bubbles from my nose. Years of pranayama made it even harder for me to give up nasal breathing, but I reminded myself that yoga is also about having a flexible mind, and I appreciated that aspect of the challenge.\nIn fact, each part of the triathlon—swimming, biking, and running—made different demands on my body and on my breath. Exploring each one as a yoga practice helped me realize that there is still so much for me to learn about my body as I approach my seventh decade.\nThe long training bike rides and runs felt similar to lingering in challenging standing poses that seem to last forever. Even when it seemed okay in the beginning, there was always that moment when my muscles started to complain and my mind needed to recommit and keep going. That’s where tapas comes in again. I frequently found myself out of breath and already exhausted yet facing a big hill ahead. The thought came back like a mantra, “Maybe I can do that.”\nYoga teacher and triathlete David Lipsius also believes there’s a strong connection between yoga and triathlons. I met Lipsius years ago and we stayed in touch ever since. When I shared my plans for my first triathlon, he told me about his accomplishments related to completing countless triathlons, including six Ironman events. The Ironman consists of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride, and a 26.2-mile run without so much as a break.\nI sought out his advice as my event approached, and he had some words of wisdom for me. “Whether one is staring at the black line at the bottom of a pool for 3000 meters, tucked tight in an aero position riding a century at your very edge, or hammering out a marathon run with only your breath and your pulsing heartbeat for company, triathlon training is a perfect meditation, combining sense withdrawal, one-pointed concentration, and flow state freedom into one spectacular union of mind, body, and spirit,” Lipsius explained. “Both encourage a participant to leave behind ways of being that limit one’s potential; and both teach that the body, breath, and mind are capable of far more than one can imagine.” \nHis encouragement was another piece of the puzzle. I started to see that this effort wasn’t just about reimagining who I am, building up my physical capacity, and considering it as a powerful practice. His kind words also made me realize the importance of finding a supportive community.\nDiving In\nWhen the day came, my mind was more overwhelmed than my body. But I was encouraged by the camaraderie of the other racers. There was a sense that we were there to support each other rather than race against one another. I’ve always found that sense of mutual support in the accessible yoga community, and it was joyful to experience it in a new culture that I had wrongly assumed would be more competitive.\nFor example, we had to write our race number and age on our upper arms and calves, and people eagerly helped each other with that as they shared nervous laughter before the race started. At one point, I was running behind a woman who seemed much younger than me. She suddenly stopped and seemed to give up, slumping over. I slowed down and said, “If I can do it, you can do it!” She smiled, thanked me, and started running again.\nThe biggest challenge was the swim—just as I’d expected. The course took us out much farther than I had ever swum and the water was cold, deep, and dark. The middle of the course was when I couldn’t catch my breath and desperately drew on everything I’d previously learned. I slowed my breathing and I managed to repeat the magic words, “Maybe I can do it?” I ended up finishing at a faster pace than I had ever swam during my beginner triathlon training, even though I wasn’t sure I would even reach the beach!\nDuring the bike ride and run, I had to watch my heart rate, which was spiking more than usual from the excitement of the day. I continually tried to slow myself down by remembering my breath and my commitment to finishing safely. Again, my yoga training helped me work on my inner competitive nature and keep my eyes on my own mat, so to speak. To help with that, I tried to celebrate the other athletes as they passed me on the course—especially the older racers whose ages I could see on the backs of their legs—by reveling in their strength and endurance.\nBody-Mind Relationship\nThroughout the months leading up to the triathlon and since then, I’ve noticed how the relationship between my body and mind has changed. It feels like we have a more fluid and changeable relationship—mind supporting body and body supporting mind. When I felt like I couldn’t breathe during the swim, my meditation practice helped pull my mind back from fear and panic. When my muscles were complaining during the bike ride, I focused on my breath and watched the sensation pass.\nIn some ways, I can see that it was my triathlon training at work. But I also know that it was the result of hours and hours of asana, pranayama, and meditation coming together and supporting me in the most surprising ways. I don’t think I would have had the courage, or the mental strength, to take on this kind of extreme challenge without my yoga practice.\nIn the end, I finished sixth out of 14 men in my age group. More importantly, I finished safely—and I learned about myself in the process.\nSo many times during my training and racing, I found a way to work with my mind to take on new challenges and overcome fear. Yoga showed me the power of letting go of preconceived ideas about who I am and embracing the power of “maybe.” I can see now that these ideas of my abilities not only limit my body and my mind, they limit my ability to imagine what I can accomplish in life. The question I am left with is not “Who am I?” or even “Maybe I can do this?” It’s “What’s next?”\n(Photo: Courtesy Jivana Heyman)",

    "item_subtitle": "Legend Lynn Hill reveals where climbing has taken her lately, how she trains for power, and why she still loves the sport.",
    "body_content": "“It goes, boys,” Lynn Hill famously declared after becoming the first person in history to free climb Yosemite’s El Capitan in 1993. A year later, she became the first to free El Cap in a day. Three decades beyond, she’s still climbing—and hard. At 64 years old, she continues to send 5.12s and 5.13s in her backyard in Boulder, Colorado, and around the world. Through building a historic career, living in a French farmhouse, enduring a near death experience, and becoming a mother, Hill possesses a sagacity as staggering as the walls she climbs.\nHill’s New Hobbies\nAshtanga yoga is one thing. And I’ve been skate skiing for, oh gosh, it’s been more than ten years now. One thing I want to try this winter is kiteboarding. My friend keeps inviting me to come down to Lantana [in Florida], and it’s been difficult to balance the time between going to Hueco [Tanks, in Texas] or other trips for work. So, I’m going to make the time and give it a try.\nHow Learning Shifts Her Mindset\nWhen I’m learning something new, I appreciate all of the subtleties. It’s not just about strength, but knowing how to read the terrain and how to coordinate the exact force that you need to use in your ankles or your wrists, or some aspect of the balance and timing required.\nOn Staying Powerful\nOne of the newer things I’ve learned is how to generate power on the Kilter Board. I’ve been a rock climber most of my life and this kind of power is very different. It requires the coordination and the amount of power that you need to jump. That’s something I need because I’m more of an endurance climber than a power climber. As you get older, you lose power. So it’s important to maintain as much as you have and even build on it.\nHer Favorite Recent Climb\nI went to the Black Canyon of the Gunnison for the first time. Everyone’s like, “Oh, you’ve never climbed in the Black? That’s crazy.” I was always afraid of going because I heard that this pegmatite is really loose and I don’t like the idea of climbing on loose rock, but I was pleasantly surprised. There’s some loose rock, especially at the top, but you can easily avoid that or just be careful stepping around things. It’s really beautiful granite. We did a route called Journey Home and camped the night after our climb.\nWhat She’s Most Stoked to Climb Next\nI’m excited about climbing with Babsi Zangerl in the Rätikon in Switzerland. She and her partner Jacopo [Larcher] live close enough that you can mountain bike to the base of this climb. It’s probably 7c, which translates to about 5.12d. It’s adventure climbing; you don’t need to use that much natural gear, but it’s old-school because the runouts are sometimes exciting.\nWhat She Looks for in a Climbing Partner\nWhen I was younger, I remember showing up in the [Yosemite] Valley and it was pretty common for people to put their name on the bulletin board and just hook up with people randomly, because what was important was getting out there and climbing. But now it’s more important to me to climb with people who I really enjoy being with. It’s obviously safer if you care about each other. You’re going to be watching each other more closely. But it’s really just more about the experience of being with somebody you like. To me, that’s more and more important as I get older.\nHow climbing helps her age like a French wine\nI’ve noticed people who stay engaged in life are not always trying to stay within their comfort range. It’s really important to stay adaptable. If you’re always doing things in a predictable way, you lose that creativity and adaptability.\nWhy Hill keeps climbing\nAt this point in my life, it’s just part of what I do and what makes me feel good on many different levels, from the physical to the problem solving. Some days you’re feeling energized and you have that excitement in your stomach before you start a climb. Other days, you’re kind of tired. It’s all about observing and being aware of how you’re reacting in that moment.",

    "item_subtitle": "Activist Quannah ChasingHorse is the climate hero we need right now. Here’s why she says Indigenous Peoples' Day is more important than ever.",
    "body_content": "Indigenous model and activist Quannah ChasingHorse grew up in a tiny Native village in Alaska just south of the Arctic Circle, where she saw the effects of climate change firsthand her entire life. This experience and her deep connection with the land made her become an activist at a young age and use her platform as a model and actress to bolster Indigenous land rights and the climate.\nIn seventh grade, she fought to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Day in her school district in Fairbanks. At 17, she became a member of the Gwich&#8217;in International Youth Council, lobbying against oil leases to protect native lands such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and participated in climate rallies. Before she was 18, she was helping the Alaska Federation of Natives Climate Task Force push to declare a state of emergency on climate change.\nChasingHorse’s powerful energy protesting against oil drilling caught the eye of a casting director for a Calvin Klein campaign in 2020. After she was scouted, her modeling career took off, and she used her visibility as a fashion model to bring more awareness to Indigenous communities and the climate crisis.\nIn 2023, ChasingHorse graced the fall Outside cover as a new face of adventure storytelling. She opened up to us about the “long walk from rural Alaska to the runways of Paris” and what it&#8217;s like living in two different worlds—fashion and activism, which was also chronicled in a documentary from The North Face called Walking Two Worlds.\nThis year ChasingHorse lent her voice to The American Southwest, a documentary by Ben Masters, which he describes as both a love letter and a plea to protect these landscapes and wildlife. The film is a wild ride down the mighty Colorado River, exploring the region’s extraordinary wildlife, cultural history, and precarious future, and ChasingHorse narrates.\nOutside caught up with ChasingHorse while she was home in Fairbanks, Alaska. The activist tells us what drew her to The American Southwest, the most pressing issues for Indigenous communities right now, and what gives her hope in these uncertain times.\n&#8220;The American Southwest&#8221; shows an aerial view of the Colorado River. (Courtesy of Ben Masters)\nOUTSIDE: What drew you to narrating the 2025 film The American Southwest?\nQuannah ChasingHorse: What drew me to narrate to The American Southwest was, knowing that there was not a lot of representation when it came to nature documentaries, whether that be film or TV shows, and also knowing the premise of it, understanding that the story is being told for a reason, and that it has to be told. It&#8217;s an important story, learning about water management and how that&#8217;s affecting so many life ways across, in, and out of the Colorado River.\nI felt very called to lend my voice for all the different lifeways, whether that be the river to the animals to the landscapes of the American Southwest. There is a beautiful story there, and also to really share the history, and the importance of including that history, because Indigenous people have been stewarding these lands for generations, for thousands of years.\nSo to be an Indigenous person who has a connection to the Southwest, and to step into this role of being a voice for this region, it&#8217;s an honor, but also a responsibility.\nWhat issues do you feel are most pressing for Indigenous communities today?\nChasingHorse: Every community has its own individual struggles, but overall, it is the lack of awareness anytime there&#8217;s anything happening in a Native community, you don&#8217;t hear about it on national TV. You don&#8217;t hear about it at all, unless someone close to you who is Indigenous knows what&#8217;s going on and informs you.\nSo the lack of awareness around these issues, whether that&#8217;s climate change, and how it&#8217;s affecting so many of our people, even here in Alaska and in the Southwest, we&#8217;re feeling heavy and hard. The water management in the Southwest is really playing into why the climate crisis is affecting the Southwest as far and as hard as it is.\nWhen we talk about one thing, it&#8217;s hard not to talk about the other, because they are so interconnected. So all of these extractive industries, oil and gas and mining, and seeing the mismanagement of water and how all of that we as Indigenous people are the least to contribute to these issues, yet we are the most affected by it.\nThere are so many pressing issues, but right now specifically, I would say there is an ecocide and multiple active genocides happening, and we have been living in a dystopian reality. We have been overcoming this ongoing genocide for hundreds of years, and it is still happening today. So even just acknowledging that this is what&#8217;s happening, and we as Indigenous people need to be included in all spaces. That is what&#8217;s most pressing and most important, because then we can really help our communities when we&#8217;re included, and we can really bring forward solutions to a lot of today&#8217;s issues.\nWhy is it important to include Indigenous voices in conversation when it comes to the climate crisis?\nChasingHorse: In the last few years, we have also seen a lot of representation, but it is all very tokenized, so we need to really normalize Indigenous people in every space. We need to be included in these conversations, at the table when they&#8217;re making decisions on what is happening environmentally, to the economy, to water management.\nAll of the conversations surrounding this one pressing issue [of the climate crisis], we see so many people being put on pedestals whohad to find their way to that conversation. When us, as Indigenous people, we didn&#8217;t have a choice.\nWhen it comes to climate change, we are at the forefront. We are affected the most. We are the ones who are on the forefront really being affected by these issues, by the climate crisis, yet our voices are not included in these conversations, and so every single panel, every single conference, every single conversation—whether that&#8217;s politically to communally—when our communities come together to talk about these issues, it is so important that there are Indigenous people who have the lived experience of what [the climate crisis] is like firsthand.\nAs an Indigenous person, I&#8217;ve seen way too many people who have so much privilege, but want to stay relevant, try to overstept, really take up space, and really try to step into this activist role. We do need more activists. We do need more people to care. We do need more people to speak up and say something, but they&#8217;re then overshadowing the Indigenous people who need to be heard, who have stories that need to be told.\nIt&#8217;s disheartening, because it makes us feel again, small, and makes us feel as though our stories are not important enough. Then he person who doesn&#8217;t quite know exactly what they&#8217;re talking about, and even if they do know what they&#8217;re talking about, they seem to be more important than the people who are directly being affected by these things.\nHow can we talk about these things without recognizing that, as much as this is a worldwide struggle, and everyone is feeling it, to some extent, a lot of those people can just go home and turn on their AC, or go home and turn on a hot shower and be in there for hours? A lot of us from our communities don&#8217;t have that luxury.\n\nQuannah ChasingHorse lends her voice &#8220;The American Southwest&#8221; 2025 film. (Photo: Len Necefer)\nWhat&#8217;s your version of a perfect day outdoors?\nChasingHorse: A perfect day for me in the outdoors is getting bundled up, if it&#8217;s winter time, getting real bundled up,  and spending time in my mom&#8217;s dog yard with her and her dogs, hooking up the dog team and heading out on a trail. Then, usually on our long runs, we&#8217;d stop and start a fire and have a little tea. And that&#8217;s one of my favorite things to do: building a fire and having some tea and sitting around and telling stories and spending time outside with my mom&#8217;s dogs.\nWhen I&#8217;m not in Alaska, and I&#8217;m in the Southwest, in LA or in Arizona, then it’s going on hikes. There are so many beautiful trails all over the Southwest.\nIf you have access to hiking trails and beautiful spaces,  and hot springs, go. It reconnects you with your spirit and your body. When I&#8217;m outside and doing these things and going on hikes and building fires and telling stories, I go back home feeling so much better.\nI go home feeling like my cup is 100 percent full and overflowing like I can. I have so much more to give. I hope that when people do experience those things, that they then feel like they have enough to give, that they are overflowing with love and joy and happiness and clarity and groundedness, that they can just pour into other people and other things.\nAnd the last question: How do you maintain hope as an activist?\nChasingHorse: Maintaining hope as an advocate these days can be challenging, if I’m being 100 percent honest. But then I go home to my communities, and I see young people really educating themselves, learning, engaging in these conversations.\nThat&#8217;s what gives me hope, seeing that our future leaders are going to be strong and knowledgeable, and will make decisions that will benefit everyone, not just themselves.\nThat is what gives me hope. And also knowing and seeing when all of us come together, seeing people protesting, seeing people speak up, and not being afraid to tell the truth, that gives me so much hope,\nIt reminds me that there is still humanity out there, that there are people who are still so grounded and connected to their humanness that they didn&#8217;t forget that or ignore that there are so many things that need voices, that need support, and need us as advocates to be there, to stand in solidarity with them.\nThese young people, especially children, shouldn&#8217;t have to do that. They shouldn&#8217;t have to grow up working their entire lives doing the right thing. It is our job. It is our parents&#8217; and our grandparents&#8217;.  It has been their job to create a future for us that is sustainable, that is livable and that is healthy. So I also hope to see more and more of our trusted adults and our aunties, our uncles, our moms, our dads, our grandparents, see a future for us and make the right choices on our behalf.\nEditor&#8217;s note: This interview was edited for length and clarity.",

    "body_content": "I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve heard skiers whisper, “You’ve gotta go to Schweitzer.” It was the kind of resort that felt like a hidden handshake in the ski world, overshadowed by other big-name mountains out West. People who’d been there would nod knowingly, and others would ask questions. I often wondered: Could it really live up to the quiet hype?\nLast winter, my usual ski group and I finally made the gamble—and boy am I glad we did. Ahead of ski season, here’s everything you need to know about Schweitzer, the secret resort that I can’t gatekeep any longer.\nWe flew into Spokane, Wash., which turned out to be a legitimate surprise. It’s a fun little city with enough hip cafés, good food, and riverside walks to make an early or late arrival worthwhile. From there, it was roughly an hour-and-45-minute drive north through snow-swept forests, past the glittering Lake Pend Oreille, and into Idaho’s Panhandle. On that drive, you roll past Sandpoint, a town that has its own unique charm, amenities, and scenic views. It will turn out to be more thana pass-through; Sandpoint gives context and flavor to the ski resort, and we quickly carved out some exploration time to see it.\nJust 20 minutes from downtown, the snowy drive up windy Schweitzer Mountain Road spit us out in Schweitzer Village, where we checked into the Humbird Hotel—possibly one of my favorite recent stays at any ski resort. The Scandinavian-inspired hotel is design-driven, crisp but warm, and after a long day on the mountain, our room’s comfy bed was exactly what I needed. From our room, we had a mesmerizing view overlooking the slopes, which instantly got me stoked for our first ski day in the morning.\nThe slopeside Humbird combines high style with skier amenities. (Photo: Courtesy of Schweitzer Mountain Resort)\nWhile the hotel and the base village itself gives cozy, Schweitzer’s slopes tell a different story. The terrain really delivers, serving up 2,900 acres of terrain, a 2,400-foot vertical drop, and about 300 inches of snow each year. It’s a legit mountain that skis really big.\nThe terrain mix—10 percent beginner, 40 percent intermediate, 35 percent advanced, and 15 percent expert—is ideal for experienced skiers craving a new adventure away from the crowded megaresorts. But unlike other under-the-radar ski areas that have the terrain but lack the infrastructure to support it, Schweitzer’s modern lift network is efficient and easy to navigate. For instance, Stella, a high-speed six-pack, moves nearly 16,000 skiers per hour. Thanks to the fast lifts, plus the notoriously thin crowds up there in the Panhandle,  we never waited in line for more than a minute. One powder day morning we were able to lap the Outback Bowl again and again, riding the Stella chair out of the rustic Carriage House base station. It felt like something out of a ski fairytale.\nSchweitzer&#8217;s gladed terrain rivals the best in North America. (Photo: Courtesy of Schweitzer Mountain Resort)\nSome of my favorite laps: Zip Down, a fast blue groomer that begs you to open it up; Upper G3 for its quick fall-line drop; Glade-iator, which threads you through Schweitzer’s classic trees; and the legendary Kaniksu Trees, which, on that powder day, were pure magic.\nBack the Humbird, we leaned into the amenity-forward vibe, spending time at the Glass Room, a communal all-purpose space with a modern glass fireplace and three-sided windows overlooking the slopes and lake. It became our après hangout for playing games, catching up on work, and enjoying cocktails. In the evenings we soaked in the outdoor hot tub under falling snow and enjoyed dinners at the on-site Crow’s Bench, which was unexpectedly elevated for a ski village restaurant. It delivered comfort food with flair, plus a smart après menu that hit just right. In fact, I’m still thinking about their warm pretzels served with beer cheese.\nThe Humbird&#8217;s Glass Room was an oft-visited communal spot for après, games, and hangouts. (Photo: Courtesy of Schweitzer Mountain Resort)\nThe other thing that impressed me about Schweitzer was its ease of logistics. We used the can’t-be-missed Clock Tower in the village as our default meet-up point, which made it easy for even a larger ski group to stay synced. For lunch one day, we headed up to Sky House, where the windows frame views into Idaho, Washington, Montana, and even Canada, with Lake Pend Oreille shimmering below. Another day, The Nest, at mid-mountain, had solid grab-and-go fare that got us back out fast, which is exactly what you want when the snow’s that good.\nRental logistics were also seamless. The staff at Schweitzer’s Ski &amp; Ride Center tuned my skis for the day’s conditions, matched the gear to my style, and got me out the door quickly. If you’re new to Schweitzer, or new to skiing, the resort’s first-timer experience is impressive: Beginner zones are clearly marked, and they offer learn-to-ski and ride programs that ease you in without the usual first-day frustration.\nIt&#8217;s the warm, community feel that sets Schweitzer apart from other similar-sized ski areas. (Photo: Courtesy of Schweitzer Mountain Resort)\nIf you’re looking for a genuine, well-rounded vacation that harkens back to the simple, wholesome ski trips of your past, do consider Schweitzer. At its core, it offers all the components of a big-time resort with the special touches of a little gem: incredible terrain (especially the glades!), room to explore, casual dinners with friends, a starry soak in the tub, and the feeling that the mountain is all yours. It somehow feels both wide open and intimate. Crowds never get in the way, nor do logistics. Add in the easy Spokane access, the draw of Sandpoint and Lake Pend Oreille, and the Humbird’s welcoming design, and it’s now no mystery to me why so many skiers have been quietly raving about this place for years.",

    "item_title": "Keep Falling Out of Handstand? The Solution Might Be Simpler Than You Think.",
    "item_subtitle": "Step #1: Think like a kid.",
    "body_content": "Handstand is one of those yoga poses (asana) that&#8217;s wrapped in myth—that is, myth of our own making. Some see it as the Everest of asana—something only the most experienced practitioners get to summit. Others see it as a party trick—flashy, impressive, maybe even a little indulgent.\nBut think back to being a kid—throwing yourself upside down on the grass, tumbling through the air, not caring whether you stuck the landing or rolled out laughing. That spirit is the embodiment of Handstand.\nAdho Mukha Vrksasana (Downward-Facing Tree) is a practice in which you explore lightness, rhythm, and play. Patanjali spells out the same principle in the Yoga Sutras when he explains abhyasa and vairagya, or practice and letting go. We keep showing up, doing the work, and building the actions in our body day after day. And, at the same time, we continue releasing our grip on the outcome.\nHandstand teaches us this balance. You can practice for years and still fall out of the pose more often than you hold. That doesn’t mean you’ve failed. The key is in the attempt, not the stick. Just like when you were a kid, the pleasure wasn’t in “nailing it,” but in the fearless, playful ride of taking yourself upside down.\nWhat Yoga Tradition Teaches Us About Handstand\nThe Sanskrit name for Handstand says a lot. “Adho mukha” (“downward facing”) points you toward the earth. “Vrksa” (&#8220;tree&#8221;) roots you in stability. In Handstand, that tree flips upside down, asking you to grow your roots through the palms, steady the midline of the body, and let the branches—that is, legs—extend toward the sky.\nIn Iyengar yoga, the pose is often called Full Arm Balance rather than Handstand. That distinction, too, is telling. Whereas in other inversions, such as Supported Headstand (Sirsasana) and Shoulderstand (Sarvangasana), the body is supported by a wide base—the head, arms, or shoulders. They’re inversions of stability, and because of that you can stay there longer, diving into their effects on the circulation, breath, and mind.\nHandstand is different. The entire body balances on just the two palms, which makes it more precarious. The teaching here isn’t in duration but in clarity of action, precision in alignment, steadiness of mind, and lightness of body. Think of it this way: You’re not “kicking up into a handstand.” You’re growing a tree from the ground up and allowing yourself to float upward through space.\nHow to Do a Handstand: The Mind\nHandstand isn’t only about strength—it’s about rhythm, clarity, and, maybe most importantly, play. If you try to muscle your way up with a hard kick, you have the potential to fly past your destination. But if you let the breath set the pace and the actions of your body line up, suddenly there’s lift. Think about being a kid again, tossing yourself upside down without hesitation. That willingness to fall, to laugh, to get back up—bring that with you.\nFalling out doesn’t need to be dramatic. Practice cartwheeling gracefully to the side, or simply stepping down with control. A smooth exit keeps fear from creeping in and gives you the courage to try again. And don’t be shy about using the wall—it’s not a crutch, it’s a teacher, giving you real-time feedback about the linear line your searching for..\nTry weaving handstand attempts into the flow of a vinyasa class, when your body is warm and your breath has a natural groove. Over time, you’ll notice progress comes through repetition. You show up, you fall, you float, you laugh, you repeat.\nHow to Do a Handstand: The Body\nHere’s a short sequence that can help you build up to Handstand.\n1. Mountain Pose\nStart simply by standing tall in Mountain Pose (Tadasana).\n(Photo: YogaRenew)\n2. Upward Salute\nSweep your arms overhead into Upward Salute (Urdhva Hastasana), stretching up through your fingertips as your heels root down. Feel that upward pull. It’s the exact same energy you’ll channel through your palms when you’re upside down.\n3. Tree Pose\nFrom there, shift into Tree Pose (Vrksasana). Press your standing leg firmly into the mat as your lifted foot presses into your thigh. Suddenly you’re balancing. This is Handstand in disguise—rooting downward while lengthening upward, holding the midline, and allowing yourself to feel steady and strong even as you feel light and free.\n(Photo: YogaRenew)\n4. Downward-Facing Dog\nNext, fold forward and step back into Downward Dog. Press your hands into the mat, lift your sitting bones high, and let your breath create space between your ribs and pelvis. This is your launchpad. It’s also a chance to feel into the palms of your hands as they connect with the mat.\n5. Hop Into Standing Forward Bend and Back\nNow start to play. Hop forward from Down Dog into Standing Forward Bend (Uttanasana), then hop back again. No pressure to stick the landing—just let it be buoyant and fun. These transitions teach you what it feels like to glide through space while being both light and steady. Be springy, be bouncy, and landing with bent knees.\n6. Handstand Hops\nOnce you’ve found your groove, start trying a few Handstand hops. From Down Dog, lift one leg high, push the floor away through your palms, and hop with the other foot. Don’t think about kicking up—think about floating up. Even if you just hover for a second, you’ve touched the essence of the pose.\n\n(Photo: YogaRenew)\n\n7. Handstand\nAnd then, when you’re ready, go for the full thing. Step a little closer to your hands, sweep one leg high, and as you exhale, let the other leg rise to meet it. Suddenly you’re in Handstand. Press the hands down, stretch the legs long, and breathe. Maybe you hold for a moment. Maybe you cartwheel out. Either way, you’ve done it—the practice is in the attempt, not the duration.\nHow to Keep Your Perspective\nHandstand isn’t really about balance—it’s about presence. When you’re upside down, there’s no room for distraction, no room for overthinking. There’s only breath, body, and gravity in conversation with one another. Some days you’ll find the float, other days you’ll topple right back down. Both are practice.\nThe real lightness comes from not clinging to the result and instead showing up repeatedly with curiosity, rhythm, and a little of that fearless play we knew as kids. It’s the practice of abhyasa and vairagya—practice and letting go—that keeps you steady, whether you stay balanced for a breath or immediately fall back to earth.\nFloat steady, fall often, play always. That’s yoga.",

    "item_title": "How Much Weight Can Popular Backpacks Handle? This Is How We Test.",
    "item_subtitle": "The Outside Lab at CU Denver uses sensors, weights, and mannequins to figure out how different backpacks carry loads and how much each can handle.",
    "body_content": "From their external-frame origins, modern hiking backpacks have branched out into forms multitudinous. Today, you can tote anything from gossamer frameless sacks to heavily-padded beasts with pivoting hipbelts and airy trampoline backpanels. But just as pack designs today vary, so do their load capacities: While some backpacks may tap out at anything above an ultralight load, others can carry your gear, your pets, and, probably, your partners without so much as leaving your shoulders sore. When you&#8217;re picking a pack, that&#8217;s essential information.\nEvery year, our testers put dozens of packs through their paces, carrying them with different loads and across a wide variety of terrain to figure out how they perform. But no two hikes are the same, and making apples-to-apples comparisons between how packs carry is difficult with just field testing. To get more information about how different popular backpacks transfer load between the hips and shoulders, we asked Outside Gear Test Editor Adam Trenkamp to devise a lab test to measure them directly. In this video, he walks you through how we got the data in this year&#8217;s pack test.\nTranscript\nHey there, I&#8217;m Adam Trenkamp, the lab test editor here at the Outside Lab in CU Denver. Today we&#8217;re going to talk to you about backpacking packs and specifically the load capacity of packs.\nSo in the lab, we like to look at everything with our gear, and one of the things we&#8217;re going to look at with packs is load capacity and effective load. So, when you wear a pack and you have a whole bunch of weight to keep you out in the backcountry for one night or 15 nights or, you know, six months if you&#8217;re doing a thru-hike, the hip belt is meant to carry a part of that weight. A lot of times what you&#8217;ll hear is the 80/20 rule. So 80 percent of the weight in your pack should be on your hips, 20 percent on your shoulders. That&#8217;s going to shift as you walk throughout the day and you hike, or even as you load your pack a little bit differently. But the theory stands: you should have more weight being held on your hips than on your shoulders.\nSo when we test for effective load, what we look for is when does too much of the weight slip past the hip belt and start to go on the shoulders, and that&#8217;s the effective load for each pack. Some packs are designed to carry more weight than others, and we want to find out which ones those are and how much weight each pack can carry appropriately.\nAlright, let&#8217;s see how effectively Steve carries some weight here. We&#8217;re going to call him Steve. That&#8217;s his name for today.\nThat wasn&#8217;t very effective.\nSo to test the effective load of the packs, we use these flexible force sensors that plug into the computer via some USB cables here. So they read the force as it pushes down through the pack. To make sure we get the force around the whole pad when the backpack pushes down, we 3D printed some little knobs you can see stuck on top of the pad. That lets us read all four corners of the force sensor and make sure we&#8217;re getting a good representation of the weight through the shoulder pad.\nSo once we get our force sensor set up on our mannequin, we grab a pack and we get set up. You can see with some lines we&#8217;ve marked out where the top of the hip bones are for our mannequin. We use that to get our hip belt aligned with every pack.\nHip belt set. Alright, now we tighten our shoulder straps.\nOnce our backpack is fit, we go ahead and hook our force sensors up. Once we&#8217;re plugged in, we make sure our forces seem accurate, which is basically we shouldn&#8217;t be reading much force at all with just the pack because we have an empty pack. And then we zero out our load and start from there.\nSo we use some sleeping pads to stuff at the bottom of the pack. Typically this is where you&#8217;re going to pack your sleeping bag or your low-weight, bulky items to help push any heavyweight to the middle of your pack. Sleeping pads give us a little extra weight at the bottom of the pack, but still allow us to stack truly heavyweight on top. So, since we&#8217;re trying to test the actual effective load of the pack, if we just stuck some really low-weight, bulky items at the bottom of the pack, we&#8217;re going to have a harder time fitting a ton of weight in here. So by using these sleeping pads, each of these are about a pound and a half, we&#8217;re able to add three pounds to the bottom of the pack to start. And now we have some support for our heavyweight.\nTo do the test for all these packs, we start with a 13-pound weight. We record how much is being shown on the shoulders, and then we slowly add five pounds at a time after this.\nSo we keep adding weight to the packs until the force sensors on our shoulders tell us that more of the weight is actually being carried on the shoulders than the hips. So once that 50 percent mark shifts—even though we want to hold the 80/20 rule with only 20 percent on the weight of the shoulders as long as we can—we keep adding weight to the test until that 50 percent mark shifts and a majority of the weight is now on the shoulders. And then that&#8217;s our effective load point. So we can look at it as, what&#8217;s the best weight, but then what&#8217;s the true effective load of where does the hip belt fail and now a majority of the weight is on your shoulders.\nSo me and Steve here, we&#8217;re going to keep testing, but first I think he needs a little bit of a break and I&#8217;m going to help him get out of here. So we&#8217;re going to unhook Steve from science.\nAnd we&#8217;ll see you—oh god, Steve, that&#8217;s so much weight. We&#8217;ll see you later.",

(Photo: Tim de Waele/Getty Images )\nKristoff retired on the tarmac and devastatingly close to 100 career wins last weekend at the Tour de Langkawi.\nThe Norwegian traveled to Malaysia on a twin mission: To amass promotion points for Uno-X Mobility, and to take his count of 98 wins to three figures.\nKristoff long dreamed of hitting his golden century. But after placing second and twice fifth in Langkawi, his chances came to an abrupt end when he was forced to abandon after a heavy crash on the seventh stage.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s not the way I wanted to end the race or the career, but cycling is a brutal sport and it changes fast,&#8221; Kristoff later said in a video from his team.\n&#8220;Yesterday I was sick, today I felt a bit better, but then I go down very hard.

The 36-year-old will then take his track wheels for one last spin next week at the world championships in Chile.\nViviani said he’s retiring on his own terms, albeit with some external influence.\n&#8220;I started this final season wanting to prove something,&#8221; Viviani said in a team note. &#8220;I wanted to be the one to decide when to stop, even though many people asked me over the past months if I was ready to retire.\n&#8220;The merger of my team, Lotto, convinced me that this would be my final year,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;I know I&#8217;m still at a good level, which is why I want to end at the world championships – maybe even chasing that [track] rainbow jersey.&#8221;\nViviani was thrown a career lifeline by Lotto this February after he was left in the wilderness on leaving former team Ineos Grenadiers.\nHowever, Lotto&#8217;s near-definite merger with Intermarché in 2026 puts space for slowing sprinters at a premium.\nDémare’s retirement was also influenced by factors beyond his influence.\nTeam Arkéa B&amp;B Hotels will all but certainly fold this winter, and a bloated rider market will trim his chances at finding a ride for the new year.\n&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t see myself changing teams or starting a new project. I wanted to give myself time to see how far Emmanuel Hubert [Arkéa manager &#8211; ed] and the team could go,” Démare told L’Equipe. &#8220;That would have been the only option to continue.&#8221;\n&#8220;I had contacts with other teams, but given the current context with the merger between Lotto and Intermarché, I couldn&#8217;t see myself waiting until November to sign. I knew that Paris-Tours would be my last bib.”\nKristoff, Démare, and Viviani all remained hazy about their future plans, but left the door open to future roles within the sport.",

    "body_content": "The ride of the weekend wasn&#8217;t delivered by world champion Tadej Pogačar at Il Lombardia. It came from Quinn Simmons.\nThe Slovenian slugger attacked alone, smashed everyone, and won the &#8220;Race of the Falling Leaves&#8221; for a record fifth time in a row. No small feat.\nBut everyone expected that.\nThe wildest performance of the weekend came from the 24-year-old American, who opened things up with an audacious attack just three kilometers into the race to drive the day&#8217;s main break, and stayed away for nearly five hours.\nSimmons’ long-range breakaway and his stubborn drive were not rewarded with a podium — he hung on for fourth just 25 seconds behind third-place man Michael Storer — but he earned the ultimate compliment from Pogačar.\n“We were already a little scared of him on the penultimate climb because he&#8217;s a dangerous rider,” Pogačar told Eurosport of Simmons&#8217; solo flyer.\n&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t able to say anything to him, and he couldn&#8217;t say anything to me either. But it was an impressive race by Quinn, a really great ride.&#8221;\n&#8216;A really great ride&#8217;\nSimmons rides with Pogačar deep into Saturday&#8217;s Il Lombardia.  (Photo: Dario Belingheri/Getty Images)\nEven putting a little scare into Pogačar reveals just how far Simmons has come in his best season yet in the WorldTour.\nAfter winning the junior world title in 2019, he&#8217;s sometimes struggled to understand how a rider who was and remains his peer, like Remco Evenepoel, could immediately crush it in the pro ranks, but he couldn&#8217;t.\nAfter a few setbacks and the realization that he needed to work even harder to truly swing with the WorldTour bigs, Simmons is now elbowing into the conversation.\nSaturday&#8217;s ride was the latest in a string of audacious attacks across 2025 that included his first two WorldTour-level victories this season.\nAlso read: Simmons wins best teammate award at Tour de France\nAfter he attacked out of the breakaway group Saturday, Simmons hit the decisive Passo di Ganda alone and was nursing a lead of about three minutes over the chasing favorites.\nIt took the combined firepower of Pogačar and Evenepoel to finally bring him back with five kilometers left to the summit.\nSimmons tried in vain to hang on as the Slovenian surged clear toward another victory, but his tank was nearly running on empty after nearly five hours alone at the front.\nOn the long, technical descent into Bergamo, he fought back to hold fourth across the line, behind Pogačar, Evenepoel, and Storer.\nThere were no immediate quotes from Simmons at the line, but Lidl-Trek put it succinctly on its social media channels: &#8220;What. A. Ride.&#8221;\nRiding at a new level\nSimmons charges past the tifosi in Saturday&#8217;s Il Lombardia.  (Photo: Dario Belingheri/Getty Images)\nThe numbers from Simmons’ head unit revealed how big his day was.\nSimmons pushed an average power output of 350 watts and peaked at a staggering 1,270 watts on the climbs and accelerations.\nThose numbers reveal that Simmons is racing at a higher level in 2025.\nCompletely shattered at the finish, Simmons posted: “Last training session before Big Sugar,” referencing his planned start at Sunday’s gravel race in Arkansas.\nSimmons is proving he can mix old-school panache with today&#8217;s cutting-edge training that left even Pogačar tipping his cap.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nA post shared by Quinn Simmons (@skin.quimmons)",

    "item_title": "After Joy of Women's-Only Ironman World Championship, Grief Sets In",
    "item_subtitle": "The Ironman World Championship has made a lot of progress in the last three years of women’s-only racing. Now it must avoid a setback.",
    "body_content": "There was something about this year&#8217;s Ironman World Championship week in Kona that felt sad.\nDon’t get me wrong &#8211; the final edition of the women’s-only championship event was empowering and inspiring and all the things we knew it would be, based on the past three years of having race day all to ourselves.\nIt was a refreshing change from the way it had always been done, which was a shared race where male athletes were centered via a higher number of qualifying slots, earlier start waves, and more airtime on the race broadcast.\nBut as I talked to women around the island over the week, there was also a sense of heartache.\nI couldn’t quite place my finger on it until someone &#8211; and it is worth pointing out that this someone was a man &#8211; said to me: “You’ve had three years of your own race. You women should be grateful you even had this experience.”\nThere’s a lot to unpack there: a man telling women what they “should” be feeling, the use of the dismissive “you women,” the insistence we should be grateful for having tasted equality in our sport, only for it to be taken away.\nSuddenly, things started to click into place. Going from progress to setback is a hard thing to experience, in sport and in life.\nThe efforts for equality on triathlon’s biggest stage &#8211; first for the pro athletes, then for the age-groupers &#8211; made great progress in centering women’s racing. For the last three years &#8211; four, if you count the 2022 women’s-focused race (with a few men’s age-groups thrown in) on the two-day, two gender format &#8211; women got their day to shine.\nThe women&#8217;s-only Ironman World Championship gave female triathletes a unique spotlight on triathlon&#8217;s biggest stage. (Photo: Brad Kaminski/Triathlete)\nWomen, who are almost always outnumbered by men in other race venues, could gather with other women. There was dedicated coverage of the most powerful, inspiring women in the sport doing powerful, inspiring things. There was a jubilant sense of community that only happens when women feel safe to truly be themselves, exactly as they are.\nThat was still very much the vibe this week, but there was also a collective sense of grief. Many women shared with me how they’re sad about losing this special experience, where for one week, their race, their effort, and their story were the only things that mattered.\n“There’s something pretty special about looking around and seeing all the women around you choosing to do the hardest thing they could find,” Victoria Feng, an age-group athlete from California, told Triathlete this week.\nUSA Triathlon CEO Vic Brumfield echoed that sentiment: &#8220;It&#8217;s just really fun to drive down Ali&#8217;i Drive and see all these badass women running with men chirping behind them on a bike or trying to keep up, like riding their wheel. I love that. It&#8217;s a flip of a narrative that we haven&#8217;t seen as the forward-facing story. And that&#8217;s just fun for me, because it makes me feel like there&#8217;s hope for more women in the sport at every level and every distance.&#8221;\nBefore the race, 2024 Ironman world champion Laura Philipp told Triathlete she was savoring the last bits of this unique, women-centered event: “I told myself to really enjoy this. It’s the last time we’ll have the women here by ourselves. Having the whole focus on us – it feels incredibly special.”\nLike so many women on the Big Island this week, she also has fears of going back to the way things were. “When I watched the men’s race in Nice last month, it was so entertaining,” she said. “But I kept thinking, how could anyone possibly cover both races at once? The dynamics are so complex. I can’t imagine we’d get the same attention if it were combined.”\nThe empowering era of women’s-only Ironman world championship racing comes to a close, with the race returning to a one-day, mixed-gender format in 2026. (Photo: Brad Kaminski/Triathlete)\nThat sentiment pervades the concerns women have about going back to a one-day race shared with men in 2026. Ironman has not yet revealed the exact gender composition of the field, only that they’re using a new method of distributing slots.\nTo date, Ironman has not provided data on the initial races using this system, so it is not possible to ascertain whether the system yields what Ironman’s initial modeling predicted: a 2026 field skewed slightly more to current female participation numbers, with an approximate 65% male to 35% female split.\nRegardless, Kona 2026 will be a majority-male race. The attention of fans and media coverage will be split between the men’s and women’s races. The expo and merchandise tent will not be filled with women’s merchandise as it has been.\nAnd when we drive down Ali’i during race week, it will be mostly men that we see &#8211; “fairness of slot distribution in proportionality” aside, the cold, hard numbers will create this reality. No one can argue otherwise.\nIronman’s decision is a reversal of their previously stated commitment to providing men and women with separate races and broadcasts. Now, it must carry the weight and responsibility of their decision to revert back to a one-day, mixed-gender race in a way that doesn’t feel like we’re going backwards. Going back to one day with two genders is their choice, not an act of God nor a government mandate.\nCEO Scott DeRue told Triathlete the decision was made based on data that revealed the women&#8217;s-only race did not bring more women into the sport. But Ironman also released a statement this year noting “\u200B\u200Bpromising growth with a 10% increase in female participation in long-distance Ironman events from 2024 to 2025, globally.”\nFurthermore, women’s overall participation in triathlon is, in fact, increasing: According to research by SheRACES and FundHerTri, a global estimate of female participants in triathlon for 2024 rose to 37% of total participants, up from 32% in 2023.\nEven if those stats didn’t exist, three years &#8211; particularly three years following a global pandemic that disproportionately affected women &#8211; is not enough time for massive change to take root. Even expert coaches recommend a gradual, years-long build-up to transform from entering triathlon as a beginner to racing Ironman, and naturally it often takes even longer to become fast enough to qualify for the world championship. Those who started during the women’s-only era, with the goal of qualifying for a women’s-only championship race, could be feeling a bit like Charlie Brown whiffing at a football that got pulled away.\nYes, “you women should be grateful” for the last three years. But I’d caution anyone &#8211; men in particular &#8211; against telling women what they “should” feel right now, and instead let them say what they’re thinking and feeling. The experience of women matters.\nWe’ve made a lot of progress in the last three years. If we want to avoid a setback, we must acknowledge there are important lessons to be learned. Instead of telling women what they “should” do, it’s imperative &#8211; for us and for the health of the sport &#8211; to follow their lead.",

    "item_subtitle": "Little Sugar is one of a few remaining endurance races on the calendar that both attracts a professional-level field and is predominantly on singletrack.",
    "body_content": "Cam Jones and Sofia Gomez Villafañe took emphatic wins at the Little Sugar stop of the Life Time Grand Prix.\nThe two riders used similar playbooks, surging early and holding off a select few chasers, to take key victories in their hunts for the Life Time Grand Prix overall title. For Cam Jones, this was his second Life Time win of the year after a similarly aggressive Unbound win, while Gomez-Villafañe notched her first win of the 2025 Grand Prix after consistent showings thus far.\nLittle Sugar is one of a few remaining endurance races on the calendar that both attracts a professional-level field and is predominantly on singletrack. In reality, the Whiskey 50 in Prescott, Arizona, is the only race that can come close to Little Sugar, and even that vaunted race doesn’t quite have the same pull as the second-to-last stop of the LifeTime Grand Prix. All of that led to a lot of excitement around the 100km race around the many trails of Northwest Arkansas, filled with tight switchbacks, short steep climbs, and lots of extremely sharp flint rock — the same kind of material that slices up tires right up the road at Unbound.\nThat rock played no small part in the proceedings as major favorites in the men’s and women’s peloton were hindered early by punctures and other mechanicals. While we don’t know for sure, it seemed that both Keegan Swenseon and Melisa Rollins, two of the race favorites, were early victims and had to spend a large portion of their days fighting back into contention. Nevertheless, in Arkansas, flat avoidance is not just about luck, and those at the front of the race proved their worth on multiple fronts, producing strong, clean runs that paid off dividends in the tight battles for the overall title.\nBehind Jones, the rest of the men&#8217;s top ten looked very different from the past few races, as the singletrack demands of Little Sugar gave the better bike handlers an edge. Bradyn Lange was a case and point of this, with the US Gravel National Champion taking second behind Jones. In a similar vein, Andrew L’Esperance was third, clawing back through the field with his deep mountain biking experience.\nThe race also produced some under-the-radar riders notching big results, with young riders like Caleb Bottcher, Kyan Olshove, and Cobe Freeburn pushing their way into the top 10.\nBehind Villafañe, Alexis Skarda came closest to challenging for the win, with the American finishing second. Throughout the race, she proved to be the only one in Gomez-Villafañe’s area code as the race behind her splintered. Rollins proved not to let the early issues hold her back too much as she worked her way all the way back to third by the end. It was an impressive comeback considering she was down in 15th, nine minutes back from the lead, at mile 30.\nBehind the top three, it was a slew of top mountain bikers who made their mark, with Hannah Otto finishing fourth. That was another note on her strong CV of marathon mountain bike results, including a national championship earlier this year. Similarly, Michaela Thompson put together he best result since her podium at Leadville last year with a strong fifth-place performance, closing out the top five.\nCam Jones commands the field with a storming solo win\nCameron Jones after winning the 2025 Little Sugar mountain bike race.  (Photo: Dan Hughes/Life Time)\nOnce the racing got underway, Cam Jones took the reins early in the race and made his power everybody else’s problem, leading the peloton into the trails and never looking back. Bradyn Lange was the closest follower early on, as the US Gravel National Champion has been on a tear lately, with Matt Beers, Sean Finchamp, Andrew L’Esperance, Matthew Wilson, and Michael Garrison the only riders to be in contact through mile 6. The lead group would only diminish from there with the next 54 miles of mostly singletrack, prying the race apart bit by bit.\nThe big names missing from the front were Keegan Swenson and Cole Patton, the marathon mountain bike World Champion and National Champion, respectively. Swenson seemed to be dealing with flat tires, while Patton was facing challenges with his freehub body. Both riders managed to get back into the fight for the top ten of the race, alongside Zach Calton, who also appeared to suffer from mechanicals, but none of them would get back to fight for the win among the riders who went off the front early.\nAmong that original group of seven, three split off the front around the 30km mark as Jones kept pushing a furious pace. He took Beers and Lange with him before going solo on his own before the halfway point. Even though he gapped Lange and Beers, Lange was able to stabilize the gap under a minute and hold it there through the arduous middle section of the race. Lange is renowned as the best bike handler in the US endurance peloton, and used that to match up with Jones’ skill and obvious strength as the Kiwi mashed his way around the course.\nBehind, the big change came from L’Esperance overtaking Beers and setting off in pursuit of Lange and Jones. L’Esperance was a Wild Card winner at this year’s Life Time Grand Prix, but that belies his ability in the marathon discipline, where he has been a top rider for the last decade. This set up the finale of the race as Jones, Lange, and L’Esperance did battle through the green tunnels that kept the competition out of sight, even with gaps hovering around the minute mark.\nUltimately, Jones was just too strong for the rest of the field, and that minute gap grew as the race worked its way into the final 20 miles of the race. Lange kept it reasonably close, but he wasn’t able to get back on the wheel of the flying Kiwi. Jones won with a time of 4:17:00, 2:38 ahead of Lange. In the battle for third, Beers pushed L’Esperance, but in the end, the Canadian prevailed, nabbing the final place on the podium at 6:01 back and 1:13 ahead of Beers. Calton capped a nice comeback with a fifth-place finish on the day.\n“I just had awesome legs,&#8221; Jones said of his race. “The plan was to be in the single track as far forward as possible so I could ride my own pace and not get caught in traffic. For the first five minutes at the start of the single track, I was behind Matt Beers, but after that, I led the whole time.”\n“Just like Unbound, it was good to ride my own race, ride my own line on the downhills. I think I overcooked the first half a little bit. I was suffering from a few cramps before halfway, so it was good to have a bit of a buffer and sit up a couple of times before managing the gap to Bradyn.”\nMen’s top ten:\n\nCam Jones – 4:17:00\nBradyn Lange – 4:19:38\nAndrew L’Esperance – 4:23:01\nMatt Beers – 4:24:14\nZach Calton – 4:26:05\nCaleb Bottcher – 4:26:06\nCole Patton – 4:26:08\nSean Finchamp – 4:26:11\nKyan Olshove – 4:26:20\nCobe Freeburn – 4:30:04\n\nSofia Gomez Villafañe is unstoppable again in Arkansas\nSofia Gomez Villafañe crosses the line in Bentonville, Arkansas. (Photo: Dan Hughes)\nThe women’s race went off just a few minutes after the men&#8217;s, and early on, a similar pattern emerged as Sofia Gomez Villafañe was off the front early, driving the pace and prying a small collection of top riders away through the first singletrack moments.\nThrough mile six, only Alexis Skarda could match Villafañe, as Samara Sheppard, Michaela Thompson, Hannah Otto, and Ruth Holcomb were the next closest, but they were already sliding back. Villafañe was taking the fight to the rest of the field and kept pushing as those in her wake slowly fell away from her wheel.\nAlexis Skarda pushed Villafañe all the way home in the women’s race, where she was the only rider who managed to stay in touching distance to the flying Argentine.  While Villafañe got away from her relatively early in the day, Skarda remained close enough to hang around in case Villafañe got hung up with any mechanicals. Ultimately, that never materialized, but second was a nice consolation prize for the rider who had a tough go of it this year, with a crash in her first race of the year at BWR Arizona interrupting the preparation for the races to come.\nThe race, for the most part, was settled fairly early in the day, with the top five at mile 30 almost exactly the same as the top five across the finish line. The only major change was Melisa Rollins making a massive charge up the rankings in the second half of the race. Clearly, Rollins was beset by multiple flats early on, ultimately pushing her all the way down to fifteenth through the midway point.\nOver the next 32 miles, Rollins showed just how strong she was, rampaging through the rest of the top contenders. Finishing third, only five minutes back after being nine minutes down at the halfway point, shows how much of a fight she would’ve put up with a clean run.\nNevertheless, flat avoidance is part skill, and the rest of the top five deserve credit for making it through the long singletrack route with a clean mechanical record, especially the winner.\n“I found myself solo after the first grass hill, and I saw that Melissa was a bit buried, so I decided to push and see what happened,” Villafañe said of her race. “This summer we had a big push with Keegan going for Leadville and the World Championships,” “I feel like I had to give him a lot of myself to take care of things around the house because I really thought he could accomplish those goals.\n“Once he got those done, it was time for me to be a bit more selfish and ask him to contribute a bit more. It’s been an interesting season, up and down physically and mentally, but this week I have been really relaxed. It has been really calm with just Matt, Brad, and I, so it&#8217;s been really calm.\n“It all just kind of clicked together.”\nWomen’s top ten:\n\nSofia Gomez Villafañe – 5:08:32\nAlexis Skarda – 5:11:29\nMelisa Rollins – 5:13:44\nHannah Otto – 5:14:25\nMichaela Thompson – 5:14:45\nSamara Sheppard – 5:16:46\nCrystal Anthony – 5:18:59\nHaley Smith – 5:20:44\nMaude Farrell – 5:21:24\nDeanna Mayles – 5:24:31",

    "item_subtitle": "Reports suggest world champion Pogačar may be considering a repeat of key elements of his 2024 program.",
    "body_content": "Tadej Pogačar went close to winning Paris-Roubaix in his first participation this year but according to Belgian media, the Slovenian world champion is considering wiping that race plus another key classic from his calendar in 2026.\nRoubaix is one of just two monuments Pogačar is yet to win; he took his fifth consecutive Il Lombardia on Saturday, and also won three editions of Liège-Bastogne-Liège and two of the Tour of Flanders.\nHe made his Roubaix debut this season and went close to victory, being locked in a duel with Mathieu van der Poel until he crashed on a corner with 38km to go. He finished second.\nBut while Roubaix is a major career goal for him, HLN.be is reporting that he is considering skipping both that event and the Amstel Gold Race next year.\nThe reason? So that he can take a break between Flanders and Liège.\nAccording to the Belgian newspaper, Pogačar and his UAE Emirates-XRG team are considering another tilt at the Giro d’Italia, a race he won in 2024 prior to doing the Giro-Tour-worlds triple.\nIf so, that could set up a thrilling showdown with Jonas Vingegaard, who is reportedly considering a Giro-Tour program.\nHLN suggests that Pogačar and UAE Team Emirates feel targeting the Tour, the Vuelta and the world championships is an impossible task.\nThe rider had originally intended doing exactly that trio of races this year but was subdued during the final week of the Tour de France and, hinting at burnout, scratched the Spanish grand tour from his schedule.\nFor now he is staying tightlipped about his plans. “I don’t want to look too much ahead to 2026. First some rest, before the casino starts again,” he said.\nPogačar’s agent: ‘For sure next year he deletes some races’\nTadej Pogačar was cheered on by spectators close to the finish of Il Lombardia (Photo: Luca Bettini &#8211; Pool/Getty Images)\nIt will likely be December or January at the earliest before the first news emerges about Pogačar’s program for 2026.\nUntil then nothing is certain. However it is already clear that adjustments will be made to what was a very hectic schedule this year.\nAccording to his agent Alex Carera, that schedule was the reason why Pogačar lacked his usual spark in the final week of the Tour.\n“In the end, Tadej is a young guy, a young man, and he’s human, and he needs recovery,” he told Velo last month.\n“It’s the first time that is you don’t see the smile on his face, because he was really tired.”\nHe underlined that things will be different next time around.\n“For sure next year he deletes some races, because he rode too much,” Carera said. “People don’t understand it is not easy to be Tadej Pogačar. For other riders, if they arrive second, sometimes it is a great result.\n“For the fans, if Tadej arrives second, he is the first who loses.”\nCarera said that the rider and his team will sit down at the October training camp and weigh up the best way to approach next season.\n“For sure they will find the right balance between the races that he loves, and the races that are important for the team.”\nHowever, in the same interview he underlined one race as being a key target; this differs from HLN’s story, and creates a little confusion about what that lighter schedule might look like next year.\n“The Tour de France is for sure a big goal next year,” he said. “And also San Remo, and Roubaix.”\nIf that is indeed the case, it may be Amstel plus another race or two which gets the chop.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nA post shared by Il Lombardia (@ilombardia)",

    "item_subtitle": "Vermeersch improves on silver medals in 2023 and 2024, beating Biesterbos and Mohorič for the rainbow jersey.",
    "body_content": "Florian Vermeersch pulled off a huge ride to win the gravel world championships on Sunday, improving on his silver medals of 2023 and 2024.\nThe Belgian rider was up the road for much of the 180km race, attacking inside 140km to go with Floris Van Tricht (Belgium) and Frits Biesterbos (Netherlands), and remaining clear with the latter until 19km to go.\nHe then put in a huge uphill acceleration to drop the Dutch rider and roared in to the finish 40 seconds clear.\n“It’s unbelievable. I don’t realize it fully yet. It is incredible,” he said.\n“It was a really hectic start and after 10k I had a puncture. But luckily 20 kilometers later I could get back to the peloton. I saw a good moment and I went for it. I didn’t see much of the peloton, I was always chasing or in the front.\n“Then once we got away with three and ultimately four, I knew there was only one way to the finish.”\nThe 2023 gravel world champion and former Milan-San Remo winner Matej Mohorič (Slovenia) took bronze, dropping the Swiss rider Félix Stehli with approximately 15km to go and racing in 1:23 behind.\nOlympic MTB champion Tom Pidcock (Great Britain) was expected to perform strongly but the fatigue of Saturday’s Il Lombardia cost him in the race. He had to make to with sixth, being outsprinted to the line by Foris van Tricht (Belgium) and Stehli.\nHigh expectations on Pidcock\nBritish rider Tom Pidcock was one of the favorites for the elite race but appeared tired after Il Lombardia (Photo: Drik Waem / Belga Mag / Belga via AFP)\nFollowing Saturday’s elite women’s race, won by Lorena Wiebes, Sunday saw the men’s field go head to head over 180km. There was 1,650 meters of climbing on the menu, something riders such as Pidcock would hope to avail of.\nAll eyes were on the Olympic champion but he had two barriers to a gold medal. Firstly, he has done no gravel races this year and never ridden the gravel worlds.\nMore significantly, he competed in Il Lombardia on Saturday. While his sixth place was a very solid result, the fatigue of that was certain to still be in his legs and to make things more difficult on Sunday.\nThe high pace and the technical nature of the course whittled the peloton down to approximately 60 riders. Vermeersch made his move inside 140km to go, going away with Van Tricht and Biesterbos.\nThe trio were caught soon afterwards by Nils Politt (Germany), and had 1:50 with 100km left. The latter was however under pressure out front and had to stop with gear problems.\nHe was caught by an attacking Mohorič and Stehli, and this trio were half a minute back with 60km to go.\nPolitt then dropped back, while behind a frustrated Pidcock was trying repeatedly to get clear of a group containing a number of Belgian riders.\nBreakaway riders consolidate their position\nVermeersch suffered a bad leg injury in early 2024 and has been trying to get back to 100 percent since then. His gesture at the finish was a nod to that. (Photo: Marcel van Hoorn / ANP / AFP) \nWith 40km left Vermeersch and Biesterbos were 40 seconds ahead of Mohorič and Stehli. This went up to 58 seconds over the next 20km, by which time Pidcock’s group had slipped to almost two minutes back.\nThe Briton realized the door was closing and put in a big uphill move, dropping all bar Tim Wellens (Belgium), but the other riders fought their way back up to them and the chance was lost.\nVermeersch could sense the gold medal getting closer and closer. He attacked Biesterbos on a climb 19km from the finish, while Mohorič dropped Stehli on the Bronsdalweg climb soon afterwards to make certain of bronze.\nVermeersch was on a good day and said that his tactics were straightforward.\n“To be honest we had very little information. Sometimes we had some people saying the gap, but I never knew who was behind,” he explained.\n“It was always by looking or by seeing them in the back. For me it was just focusing on myself and getting to the line.”\nThe 26 year old competes for UAE Team Emirates and won the Antwerp Port Epic race in 2022. His progression has been slowed by complications in recent years, including a fractured femur in February 2024.\nThat made victory all the more important to him on Sunday.\n“It is like the end of a long comeback, I would say,” he smiled. “To win again after two difficult years is really amazing. To end the season like this…I have no words, really.”",

    "item_subtitle": "The new biography Dirtbag Billionaire explores Yvon Chouinard's philanthropy, as well as his life as a Yosemite climber and alpinist.",
    "body_content": "“I’d feel a lot more comfortable on top of a mountain than here right now,” Yvon Chouinard once told President Bill Clinton while participating in a conference on corporate responsibility.\nThat’s because Chouinard is a reluctant corporate leader. His biggest accident was no blunder in the mountains, but becoming a billionaire. And his greatest legacy is not one of his first ascents or gear innovations, but giving his billions away to help save the planet he loves exploring. In short, this is the narrative arc of the life of Chouinard, a humble descendant of French-Canadian fur trappers. It’s also the story told in the new biography Dirtbag Billionaire by New York Times correspondent David Gelles.\nChouinard may not have intended to become the founder of two companies. But, as an avid adventurer, he couldn’t help but try to improve upon the mediocre outdoor gear available at the time. His innovations in layers and synthetic apparel officially became Patagonia in 1973. Sixteen years later, he sold the hard goods arm of his operation that made nuts, ice axes, and more equipment to employee Peter Metcalf, who incorporated his new business as Black Diamond. Today, both companies are among the most recognizable brands in the outdoors.\nBut in 2022, Chouinard did something arguably even more memorable (in the long run). He established the Patagonia Purpose Trust, ensuring that all profits not reinvested into the company would forever go toward the company’s mission of “saving our home planet.” Patagonia has long donated one percent of its profits to fight climate change and support other environmental causes. But this restructuring significantly increased annual giving to an estimated $100 million. Chouinard also transferred all of his family shares to the trust.\nWhile Dirtbag Billionaire is worth a read for its concrete ideas on how capitalism can do better, for climbers, it holds no shortage of colorful outtakes from Chouinard’s early days as a gritty Yosemite Stonemaster.\nTo record these stories—and render a portrait of the world’s wealthiest dirtbag—Gelles retraced Chouinard’s many journeys across his 86 years. This included fishing trips in Argentina, and a 1968 expedition to the spires of Cerro Chaltén that inspired the Patagonia logo.\nGelles and Chouinard fishing in Las Pampas, Argentina (Photo: David Gelles)\nThe vignettes in Dirtbag Billionaire unequivocally show that Chouinard was once the dirtbag to end all dirtbags—and remains so at heart. Yet at the same time, he was steadily building a brilliant career, even as he subsisted off wild squirrels or celebrated his 30th birthday stranded in an ice cave. Check out some of our favorite tales from Chouinard’s dirtbag days below.\n10 vignettes from Yvon Chouinard’s life as a climber\n(Photo: Courtesy Simon &amp; Schuster)\nWill climb for birds of prey\nThe unlikely reason Chouinard first got into climbing? Falcons. Before he sent El Cap, surfed Pacific waves, or fished the rivers of Wyoming, his first passion was falconry, the ancient tradition of training and flying falcons. It all started when he was around 15 years old and attended his first meeting of the Southern California Falconry Club.\nIn his ensuing pursuit of nests near Los Angeles where he could find falcons, Chouinard “learned to scamper down sheer walls … keeping his toes perched on inch-wide ledges,” as Gelles writes. As Chouinard sought out steeper walls, he started using ropes. He even served as a volunteer in the effort to save the endangered peregrine falcon. This involved breeding the birds in captivity and placing their eggs in wild nests.\nNovice climbers, circa mid-1950s\nAfter a member of the falconry club began teaching Chouinard about climbing, he tried rappelling for the first time. Due to a lack of gear like ATCs, harnesses, or even Swami belts (primitive and early iterations of harnesses fashioned from webbing), his rap setup was beyond sketchy. Gelles describes Chouinard’s rappel system as follows: “wrapping the rope around his waist and over his shoulder.” He loved the “feeling of dangling from a rope, bouncing off the face of a cliff, feeling like a Slinky flipping down a set of stairs.”\nShortly thereafter, Chouinard took his first-ever climbing trip to Wyoming’s Wind River Range. Still very much a novice, he decided to attempt a summit of Gannett Peak, Wyoming’s highest mountain. He reached the summit despite his decidedly non-technical Sears Roebuck work boots and outran a storm on the descent. From there, he headed to the Tetons. Luckily, old pros like Royal Robbins and Tom Frost took him on as a mentee.\nYvon Chouinard (right) climbing with Tom Frost (left) on Sespe Wall in Ojai, CA, 1974 (Photo: Gary Regester / Courtesy of Patagonia)\nTrappings of a dirtbag\nForget the sleep setup in the trunk of your Honda Civic or cans of beans for dinner. Without a real tent, Chouinard improvised his sleep setup with “an old shower curtain,” writes Gelles. Homeless in the Tetons, he seasonally took up residence “in an abandoned incinerator on the banks of Jenny Lake.” His diet often consisted of “porcupines, grouse, and squirrels,” plus any fish he could catch. And as the story goes, he also ate cat food straight from the can. Along with dirtbag buddy Ken Weeks, Chouinard purchased a case of dented cat food at the price of five cents a can. They ate the cat food “over the course of a summer,” according to Gelles. “I was a dirtbag climber,” Chouinard told Gelles, “I had no money whatsoever.&#8221;\nChouinard also enjoyed van life far before it was cool. In 1968, he and his adventure buddy Doug Tompkins outfitted a 1965 Ford Econoline van with a sleeping platform and shelves to stash all their climb, ski, surf, and fishing gear. Declaring themselves the “Fun Hogs” (their goal was to “hog fun”), they booked it south from California to Patagonia. It took them four months to reach their destination, but they weren’t in a hurry.\nScares\nLike many bold climbers of his era, Chouinard was no stranger to scares. Chalk it up to a combination of pushing the sport’s limits and inadequate gear. In the Tetons, for example, Chouinard tried for a first ascent of the Crooked Thumb. Run-out and tired, Chouinard reached for a hold that broke. He fell 160 feet before the rope caught his fall, leaving him with a bone-deep cut to his leg.\nOn that fateful Patagonia road trip in 1968, Chouinard, Tompkins, Chris Jones, and Dick Dorworth spent 31 days stuck in an ice cave on Cerro Chaltén (you can read a firsthand account of that frigid month from Dorworth here). Chouinard slashed his knee open while chopping ice and celebrated his 30th birthday nursing it in the cave. To pass the time, he read Joseph Campbell’s The Hero With a Thousand Faces. After a month of suffering, they finally got a weather window and summited Cerro Chaltén on December 20, 1968, making the third successful ascent.\nOver a decade later, in 1980, Chouinard participated in an expedition to summit Minya Konka (24,800 feet) in the Himalaya. While glissading down from Camp II, an avalanche struck, sending Chouinard, Rick Ridgeway, Jonathan Wright, and Kim Schmitz on a quarter-mile ride over a 30-foot cliff. Schmitz got tangled in the rope and broke his back, while Wright broke his neck and died moments later. The incident complicated Chouinard’s perspective on alpine objectives “for years,” according to Gelles. “Fuck these mountains,” he said to Ridgeway on the hike out.\nFirst ascents in South Korea\nChouinard reportedly drank an entire bottle of soy sauce in an effort to spike his blood pressure and evade a draft for the Korean War. It didn’t work, so he begrudgingly deployed to Seoul in 1962. According to Chouinard himself, he was such a pain in the ass in the service that his sole job became to power off and on a generator. By day, Gelle writes that he “wandered off base and found granite walls to climb around Seoul,” where he made a number of first ascents.\nDIY before YouTube\nChouinard embarked on his gear career, with no engineering degree, no apprenticeships, and zero formal education in product design. Instead, he checked out a book on blacksmithing from his local library and got to work on his first project: improving the piton.\nOver time, he became proficient enough in forging steel to produce two pitons per hour. He sold his pitons for $1.50 a pop, considerably more than the going price in Europe of 15 to 30 cents per piton. But the Europeans were forging their pitons from iron, which was softer and therefore less durable than Chouinard’s steel variety. With the harder metal, Chouinard’s pitons could be removed from a placement in rock “without getting deformed,” writes Gelles. Chouinard argued that their reusability made them worth the higher rate.\nMisadventures in fixed gear\nWhen Chouinard went climbing and his handmade pitons wouldn’t fit in the cracks, he came home and tinkered with them. This didn’t always work out. For example, to attempt a finger crack on Yosemite’s Kat Pinnacle, he broke the end off a power hacksaw blade and threaded a sling through the blade’s hole. On a 1960 attempt on Kat Pinnacle with Tom Frost—who later became his business partener—they tried hammering this improvised gear into a crack, but “it shattered into pieces,” according to Gelles. After bailing, Chouinard set about inventing the razor-thin, steel-fashioned RURP: the Realized Ultimate Reality Piton.\nIn the mid ‘60s, The North Face was one of the first brick-and-mortar spots where Chouinard’s pitons, carabiners, and other gear could be purchased. Founded by Chouinard’s adventure buddy Doug Tompkins, The North Face was an eclectic retailer of “outdoor gear and knickknacks,” as Gelles describes it.\nRight brain tinkerer\nDespite the technical nature of his products, Chouinard is more of an artist than an engineer, according to his contemporary, Royal Robbins. To this end, Gelles includes a beautiful quote from Robbins about Chouinard: “A poetic soul, Chouinard really rather disdains the analytical mind, for he hates to see beautiful things ripped and torn. He has the kind of mind which would make a good artist but a poor chess player. Maddeningly creative, Chouinard has invented more techniques and devices in climbing than anyone I know.”\nTogether, Robbins and Chouinard, along with Tom Frost and Chuck Pratt, made the first ascent of the North America Wall in 1964, topping out on the day before Halloween.\nChouinard teaching Gelles to fish on Wyoming&#8217;s Snake River (Photo: David Gelles)\nCrusty at heart\nFor all his generosity and vision, Chouinard is not always portrayed by Gelles as a warm or welcoming soul when it comes to other humans. He notes that some climbers characterize Chouinard as “elitist.” With his dedication to the preservation of Yosemite and other wild landscapes, “he at one point proposed limiting climbing in the Valley to only the best, creating an invitation-only Yosemite Climbing Club,” says Gelles. Though he’d been mentored himself, he “had little patience for neophytes or weak athletes, and at times equated physical fitness with moral superiority.”\nWhether you think that’s completely cringe or just Stonemaster-style crustiness typical of the era, Dirtbag Billionaire doesn’t shy away from Chouinard’s flaws. Gelles avoids lionizing Patagonia’s leader, describing Chouinard’s mercurial leadership style that often bewildered his staff at Patagonia.\nThe invention of “clean climbing”\nIn keeping with his environmental ethos, Chouinard set his sights on optimizing an even more reusable piece of gear than the piton: the chock, now known as the nut. To precipitate the shift from pitons to chocks, Chouinard coined the phrase “clean climbing.” In a catalog peddling his chocks, Chouinard published an essay by California mountaineer Doug Robinson. “Climbing with only nuts and runners for protection is clean climbing. Clean because the rock is left unaltered by the passing climber,” Robinson wrote.\nIn the intro to that catalogue, Chouinard and Frost promoted the paramount importance of style. “It is the style of the climb, not the attainment of the summit, which is the measure of personal success,” they wrote.\nDirtbag Billionaire was published on September 2 by Simon &amp; Schuster. It’s available wherever books are sold.",

    "body_content": "The 2025 Ironman World Championship title may have evaded her by 35 seconds, but Kat Matthews is the new queen of the run in Kona.\nOn an excessively hot and humid day on the Big Island that saw pre-race favorites Lucy Charles-Barclay and Taylor Knibb implode in mutual self-destruction, Matthews put on a clinic to split the marathon in 2:47:23 &#8211; that&#8217;s an average of 6:22/mile pace.\nIn doing so, Matthews broke Laura Philipp’s 2023 run course record by a minute, and also dipped under an elusive standard that the likes of three-time champion and one of the sport&#8217;s greatest runners Miranda Carfrae chased throughout her career.\n“I’m really happy,” Matthews told Triathlete after the race. “I did my best today, and it wasn’t enough for the win. But I’m satisfied. I really tried hard.”\nMatthews, 34, only began her pro career in 2021, but in those four years she&#8217;s established herself as one of the very best in the sport &#8211; finishing second at this race three times and setting the overall Ironman course record in Texas this April, stopping the clock in 8:10:34.\nAlong the way, she&#8217;s proven she can ride the edge harder than pretty much anyone. Saturday was no exception.\nThe race was “really up and down,” Matthews said. She didn’t swim quite as well as she felt like she did, exiting the water over six minutes behind leader Charles-Barclay. And she couldn’t hold the numbers she hoped to on the bike.\n“I gave myself a lot to do &#8211; too much to do &#8211; on the run,” she said.\nShe had a 14-minute deficit to overcome heading out of T2 &#8211; a seemingly impossible gap to bridge, especially on a day with temperatures pushing 90 degrees F in 80% humidity. Her key to belief? Shutting the facts out.\n“It didn’t even cross my mind what the conditions were of the day, to be honest. Whether it was hot, windy, it didn’t cross my mind once,” she said. &#8220;I knew what I could hold in terms of heart rate. And I guess I played it safe for a while, and it wasn’t until I was coming out of the Energy Lab that I was like, ‘Come on, you can do better than this.’”\nIt was then, running up out of the Energy Lab with less than 10 miles to go and finding out that she was still four minutes down, that Matthews once again tuned out the world.\nWatch our exclusive video interview to find out how she chipped that deficit down to just 25 seconds, how she feels about her second consecutive runner-up finish, and how she ran so freaking fast.",

    "item_subtitle": "A yoga instructor's routine takes you through stretches that focus on loosening tight hips and eliminating tension in the lower back.",
    "body_content": "This routine takes you through some stretches that will help loosen up your hips and lower back.\nWhen doing these stretches, you want to pay attention to the cues your body gives you and work with your body and range of motion—you’re not trying to push through or chase sensation. So, if the stretch feels like too much, you can modify the pose or lessen the intensity by easing out of it a little.\nHere are four simple stretches for your hips and lower back.\n4 Stretches to Release Hip and Lower Back Tension\nThroughout each stretch, try to really tune into your body and your breath. Take slow, steady breaths in and out through your nose.\nGrab any props you have at home, ideally two blocks, or substitute some firm pillows. Keep them near your mat in case you want to use them in any pose.\n1. Child’s Pose\n(Photo: Yoga With Kassandra)\nHow to Do It: \n\nBegin by kneeling on a mat, floor, or rug.\nBring your big toes to touch and widen your knees as much as feels appropriate to you.\nSink your hips toward your heels and bring your forehead and chest forward toward the mat in the low back stretch known as Child’s Pose.\nReach your arms in front of you and then pull your shoulders away from your ears, keeping them relaxed. Breathe here.\nWhen you’re ready, push your hands against the mat, slowly lift your chest, and walk your hands back toward you, inch by inch, until you come to hands and knees.\nBring your knees beneath your hips and notice what type of movement you’d like to take.\n\nIf the stretch feels too difficult, bring one block under your chest and the other under your forehead. You may also find this pose comfortable with a block (or pillow) underneath your behind for support.\n2. Dragon Pose\n(Photo: Yoga With Kassandra)\nHow to Do It: \n\nStart kneeling on the mat and step your right foot to the outer edge of your right hand. You want your knee directly over your ankle and your toes pointing forward. You can stay on your palms, you can grab your blocks and place your hands on them if the mat feels a little far away, or you can come down onto your forearms.\nPress down through your big right toe so you’re not rolling onto the outer edge of that foot. At the same time, let your hips sink toward the mat by allowing your pelvis and lower back to feel heavier.\nTake your time to settle into the shape, find your edge, and then resolve to be still. (Try not to push against the mat with your hands or forearms.) Breathe here.\nSlowly start to lift yourself.\nSwitch sides and repeat.\n\nThis is a more intense stretch. If it feels challenging to let gravity pull your hips down, it’s usually because you went a little too far into the stretch and maybe need to back off a little.\nAlso, if it feels like you have to contract and engage the muscles in your legs to hold the stretch, that’s usually an indication that you went too far. Another sign that you went too far is if you have a hard time taking slow, steady breaths. So let your breath be your guide as you hold here.\n3. Half Shoelace\n(Photo: Yoga With Kassandra)\nHow to Do It: \n\nFrom a sitting position, bring your left heel behind you, closer toward your glutes, and straighten your right leg in front of you.\nCome into a forward fold, targeting the back of your right hip as well as your hamstrings. If this feels too tough, don&#8217;t bend down so far.\nWhen you’re ready, push your hands into the mat as you lift yourself back up, slowly and mindfully. See what movement you need to recalibrate, maybe straightening your legs in front of you or doing a windshield-wiper motion with your knees.\nSwitch sides and repeat.\n\n4. Reclined Butterfly\n(Photo: Yoga With Kassandra)\nHow to Do It: \n\nLower yourself onto your back\nBring the bottoms of your feet together.\nSlide your feet a little further away from your body, and let your knees fall apart. (It can feel good to place one block, pillow, or rolled blanket underneath each knee for support.)\nBring your arms overhead for a gentle stretch through the chest and shoulders. (Alternatively, you can keep your hands on your low belly or let your arms rest at your sides, palms facing upward.)\nClose your eyes, relax your jaw, and see if you can feel the flow of your breath as it travels all the way to your abdomen. Feel your navel rise and fall as you remain still here.\n\nWant more Outside health stories? Sign up for the Bodywork newsletter. Ready to push yourself?

    "body_content": "A victory in Kona is a pinnacle accomplishment in itself, and Solveig Løvseth won the 2025 Ironman World Championship in &#8211; and we do not say this lightly &#8211; one of the best races of this event’s 47-year history.\nAnd that was after a nearly race-ending incident right when the gun went off.\n“There was a paddle board right in front of me at the start,” Løvseth told Triathlete in an exclusive interview after the finish. “And there were obviously people on both sides. So I ended up climbing over it.”\nNeedless to say, that did not set her up for success. But the 26-year-old remained calm. She found herself in a good very bike group &#8211; and found herself dropping that very good bike group.\n“Suddenly I realized they weren’t behind me anymore,” she said. “And I was like, ‘either this is really stupid, or it’s going to work out.’”\nOn a day that saw pre-race favorites Lucy Charles-Barclay and Taylor Knibb quite literally melt into the asphalt before making it to the finish, Løvseth held steady, fending off an incredibly hard-charging Kat Matthews to break the tape by 25 seconds.\n“I’m just really proud of how I was able to pace myself through the day,” she said.\nSolveig Løvseth Explains the “Real” Norwegian Method\nSolveig Løvseth on the run at the 2025 Ironman World Championship in Kona. (Photo: Brad Kaminski/Triathlete)\nLøvseth joins a rapidly growing club of Norwegians to win this race on the first try. Coincidence? She thinks not.\nEveryone talks about the “Norwegian Method” to endurance training and its emphasis on sophisticated training tactics like lactate-guided double threshold. Well, we had this hunch after Nice, and Løvseth flat-out confirmed it when we talked with her after the finish today:\nThe Norwegian Method is, at least partly, about having fun.\nThat may sound counter-intuitive for a bunch of Scandinavians who take their training seriously. Løvseth makes it make sense.\n“They’re really serious in their training, but they have a surprisingly relaxed attitude,” she said of fellow Ironman world champs Gustav Iden, Kristian Blummenfelt, and Casper Stornes. “That’s a much more fun way to live the triathlon life.”\n“I had a lot of fun in training camp going into this race,” she explains. “Of course training well, but also having a lot of fun. I’ve never been less stressed on race morning.”\nWatch our exclusive interview to learn more about Løvseth’s mindset, what she’s learned from her compatriots, and the wise racing tactics that helped her get to the finish line (in first!) on a brutal day that saw numerous pre-race favorites succumb to this unrelenting course.",

    "item_title": "‘One More Time at the Maximum’: End of an Era as Remco Evenepoel Leaves Soudal Quick-Step",
    "item_subtitle": "Seven-year relationship concludes with defiant display by Evenepoel at Il Lombardia.",
    "body_content": "He didn’t get the wins he wanted the past three weekends, but Remco Evenepoel was relieved and smiling after Il Lombardia Saturday.\nThe Belgian has had an at times greatly frustrating season, with his near-disastrous crash last winter compromising his training and leaving him without the proper foundation for key races.\nThat in turn saw his form falter at key moments, and was at least partly responsible for his abandon at the Tour de France.\nFinishing second in Il Lombardia wasn’t a victory, but it does mean he heads into the off season in fine form and with growing confidence.\nThat could be the basis for a very strong 2026: safe to say Evenepoel is back on track.\n“I am just happy with how I have been racing in the past two months, or one month and a half because I only raced from the beginning of September,” he said after the last monument of 2025.\n“I am just happy with the way I can end my season and my career at this team.”\nEvenepoel was best of the rest, leading the chase after Tadej Pogačar attacked and easily dispatched the other big favorites on the climb of Passo di Ganda.\nThat vicious surge happened inside 38km to go and the Slovenian ultimately finished 1:48 clear, although at least 10 seconds of that deficit was due to Evenepoel being delayed on the final climb close to the line.\n“Two motorbikes almost crashed in front of me on the last climb,” Evenepoel told CyclingPro.net. “That was pretty hectic, especially because I was going quite fast and then needing to stop on a 15 percent gradient is not that easy.\n“There was a bit of panic with the motorbike and all the cars around, but luckily my gap to Michael Storer was big enough to not being in trouble. In the end everything went well.”\n‘Impossible to react’\nEvenepoel wanted to win, but accepted second at Il Lombardia (Photo: Sara Cavallini/Getty Images)\nPogačar’s move and Evenepoel’s chase was a replica of how things turned out at the world championships and European championships.\nOn each occasion the Belgian was with others in pursuit, dropped them and chased alone all the way to the finish.\nThat happened again Saturday, with Evenepoel followed by Michael Storer (Tudor Pro Cycling) on the climb, and the duo reeling in Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek) before the summit.\nHe then dropped those other two riders on the descent and chased hard from there to the line.\nIt was his last day racing with Soudal Quick-Step prior to his move to Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe and he had words of praise for the dedication his teammates showed to him.\n“We had one guy in the breakaway, which was the goal. Then Matthia [Cattaneo], [Peter] Sierry, all the others really guided me through the day. So I didn’t have to worry about positioning and all that stuff.\n“Always at the beginning of the descents we were in really good positions, everything went well. So I think overall we didn’t do anything wrong. Also my positioning towards the second-last climb was really good. I was straight away on the wheel of the UAE guys so everything went super well.”\nAnd yet being in the right place at the right time was not quite enough when dealing with a rival as ferocious as the world champion.\nEvenepoel is a very ambitious rider and is desperate to try to close the gap, but he couldn’t react when the hammer went down.\n“The moment when Tadej attacked the pace was already so high for a certain minute that it was impossible to react,” he accepted. “So I had to do my own rhythm, my own pace.”\nStill, he was okay about the result, saying he was happy with his race.\nHe can’t match his big rival yet, but he hopes that next year will be different.\nSaying goodbye to Soudal\nSaturday marked Evenepoel&#8217;s last time racing in the Soudal Quick-Step jersey (Photo: Dario Belingheri/Getty Images)\nSpeaking recently, Evenepoel shrugged off a question about how the gap between the two riders will be able to be closed.\nHe said it was up to his new trainer to worry about that and to work out what to do. Collaboration with Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe will start soon and trying to find the missing percentages are certain to be top of the agenda.\nHe may well take encouragement from Saturday’s result. Okay, he was 1:48 behind Pogačar, but last year he was 3:16 behind when also finishing second.\nFor now he is grateful to Soudal Quick-Step. He may be leaving for what he feels are better opportunities, but he also recognised what he was given by that squad.\n“I am just very happy and proud to have been the leader in this team, to have taken a lot of victories for this team,” he stated.\n“Like I said this morning, I was going to give myself one more time at the maximum and I think I did it again today. I am the type of guy who will always keep fighting until the end.”\nIt’s that same ambition which sees him seek pastures new, motivated by the hope that this could be the route to Tour victory.\n“I am just happy with how everything went. The last seven years is something I will take with me for the rest of my life, but I think now it is time for something new to start.”",

    "item_subtitle": "Even if many of the park’s visitors are just passing through, it remains a vital economic resource for the nearby communities.",
    "body_content": "While the federal government shutdown has furloughed federal employees and canceled programs at national parks across the country, all programs and areas of Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) remain open and available, and the park is fully staffed. That’s due to a unique coalition of local groups that has stepped in to fund the park, ensuring it stays ready to welcome visitors during its busiest season.\nNPR first reported the story.\nGSMNP is a protected area on the border of North Carolina and Tennessee in the Appalachian Mountains. It’s also home to some of the most ancient mountains in the world.\nFollowing the October 1 shutdown, many of the park’s most visited areas were initially closed. However, a coalition led by Tennessee’s Sevier County, a portion of which lies within the park, quickly raised over $ 2 million to cover operational costs. The move allows the park’s 275 employees to remain fully paid, and was driven by a desire to keep the local tourism industry afloat.\nIf GSMNP were to be closed, Sevier County Vice Mayor Bryan McCarter told NPR that there are still many things for people to do in the area.\n“But the perception amongst a lot of folks is, well, then Sevier County must be closed. And so we have to make sure [the park stays open] to drive that economy,” said McCarter, adding that local tourism was already hit hard by Hurricane Helene in 2024 and is down ten percent this year.\nServier County Mayor Larry Waters said in a press release that it was “disappointing that the federal government has once again failed to prevent a shutdown that puts our national parks and communities at risk.”\nThe coalition is collectively donating $61,703 per day to keep the park running normally.\n“The park is a vital part of our regional economy,” Waters added, “and closing it during peak fall season is simply not an option. We are proud to welcome the hundreds of thousands of visitors who will come to enjoy the Smokies in the weeks ahead.”\nThe Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which spans over 500,000 acres, has been the most visited national park in the U.S. for decades. Its accessibility, free entrance, and major highways through its boundaries attracted more than 12 million visitors in 2024 alone, more than double the nearly 5 million who visited the next most popular park, Utah’s Zion National Park.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Americans also drive through the Great Smoky Mountains each year as part of regional travel, and their visits are counted even if they don’t get out of the car. (This is also part of the reason why the park doesn’t charge an entrance fee.) Even if many of the park’s visitors are only passing through, the park remains a vital economic resource for the nearby communities. The National Park Service (NPS) reports that GSMNP “provides an economic hub generating over $2.2 billion in 2023 and supports 33,748 jobs in surrounding communities.”\nSevier County says all areas that were closed early in the shutdown are now open and operational, including Sugarlands Visitor Center, Chimneys Picnic Area, and Cades Cove Loop Road, Visitor Center, and Picnic Area. The financial support also ensures “staff are on duty to service restrooms, respond to visitors in need, and provide essential services to protect wildlife during this peak visitor season.” The funding is limited, however, and if the shutdown doesn’t end by October 19, the park will resume operations with limited resources.\nDonors backing Sevier County include Blount and Cocke County, the towns of Gatlinburg, Sevierville, Pigeon Forge, and Pittman Center, the state of Tennessee, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the Tennessee Department of Tourist Development, and a local nonprofit, Friends of the Smokies.\nJim Matheny, Friends of the Smokies spokesperson, said that the organization chipped in because even though Great Smoky Mountains—like all other U.S. parks—was technically open to the public regardless of the shutdown, “there&#8217;s a big difference between it being accessible and being fully staffed.&#8221;\nHe compared visiting a national park with no rangers to visiting Disney World without Mickey Mouse.\nNot all areas of the park are open due to other factors unrelated to funding, such as regular seasonal road closures and rehabilitation work. Visitors can see the GSMNP&#8217;s current conditions on the NPS website.",

    "body_content": "Tadej Pogačar made history Saturday, becoming the first rider ever to take five consecutive wins in a Monument when he soloed to a dazzling victory in Il Lombardia.\nThe world champion had equaled Fausto Coppi was four straight victories last season but added another with a brilliant performance, attacking on the final big climb and reeling in lone leader Quinn Simmons.\nHe dropped the US national champion right away and while Remco Evenepoel (Soudal Quick-Step) gave everything behind, just as he did in the world and European championships, but Pogačar was unassailable.\nHe raced in 1:48 clear, taking the 20th victory of his season and the 108th of his career.\nIt was also his 50th solo win, a staggering statistic.\n“To win five times in a row … every time I start it feels that this race is really suited to me,” he said. “But also in the same time I have such a good team around me that we can pull it off. A big thanks to all the teammates.”\nThe display is the latest in a series of strong performances. Pogačar appeared muted in the final week of the Tour de France and spoke about burnout, but has bounced back following a break from racing.\nHe was the strongest rider in the GP Cycliste de Montréal, but waited for teammate Brandon McNulty and handed him the win.\nHe then dominated the world championships, the European championships and Saturday’s Il Lombardia with standout solo performances. It’s another superb run of form, and puts him in a very strong position.\n“Seven years in a row I saw this is my best season so far, and again I can say this is the best season so far,” he smiled.\nMore frustration for Evenepoel, a huge result for Simmons\nTadej Pogačar (UAE Emirates-XRG) drops his rivals on the Passo di Ganda  en route to taking Il Lombardia for the fifth time (Photo: Dario Belingheri/Getty Images)\nFor the third weekend running Simmons found himself chasing Pogačar after his big rival dropped him on a climb. He dropped Paul Seixas (Decathlon-Ag2r La Mondiale) and Isaac Del Toro (UAE Emirates-XRG) on the climb and dispatched Michael Storer (Tudor Pro Cycling) on the descent, but while he gave everything he was fated to finish second yet again.\nEvenepoel was just under 1:30 back with 5km to go and yielded further ground on the cobbled climb of Colle Aperto. He was caught behind two motorbikes which had come to a complete halt within the crowd and lost several more seconds.\nThe Belgian raced in 1:48 back, ending his time with Soudal Quick-Step with another big performance. He’s no match for Pogačar at the moment but hopes to narrow the gap next season after he moves to new team Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe.\n“I am just happy with how I have been racing in the past two months, or one month and a half because I only raced from the beginning of September,” he said.\n“I am just happy with the way I can end my season and my career at this team.”\nStorer took third, 3:14 back, with Simmons taking a superb fourth. He was the first rider to attack when the race started and ended up just 3:39 behind despite a very long, demanding day in the saddle.\nFirst attacker, top result\nSimmons was riding very strongly all day (Photo: Dario Belingheri/Getty Images)\nUS national champion Simmons has been hugely aggressive this year, going in search of victories whenever he has had the opportunity.\nHe was at it again on Saturday, attacking immediately after the race director dropped the flag. That sparked off a 14 man breakaway, with riders such as Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers), Michael Matthews (Jayco AlUla) and Pello Bilbao (Bahrain-Victorious) also present.\nThese build a solid lead and were three minutes ahead when Simmons went solo with 82.3km to go. He had 2.37 on the Pogačar group at the bottom of the Passo di Ganda, 40.7km to go. The rest of the break was caught very soon afterwards.\nSimmons hammered up the climb with one mission: go over the top in front and try to hang on to the finish. He had 36.7km remaining when Pogačar put in a big surge behind, immediately distancing the other riders and beginning to reel in Simmons.\nThe latter was caught 3km from the summit and immediately lost contact, but he was able to hold Evenepoel and Storer when they got across to him. However he was gapped with 29km to go. Evenepoel shook off Storer and began another mano a mano time trial against Pogačar, who was 1:17 ahead with 20km to go.\nThat gap would grow to 1:48 by the finish, although perhaps ten seconds of that deficit was due to being momentarily impeded by two motorbikes on the final climb.\nPogačar was elated with the result but deflected some of the complements to UAE Emirates-XRG.\n“Domen [Novak] did a fantastic job, then Pavel [Sivakov] was also really impressive today. And then all the guys leading out on the final climb and protecting me from behind.\n“It was top class work and just impressive stuff from the teammates.”\nIt was, but others too put in impressive rides. Simmons was one of those; finishing just 25 seconds off third place despite being out front all day was a massive performance.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nA post shared by TNT Sports Cycling (@tntsportscycling)",

    "item_subtitle": "Wiebes wins after nail-biting final kilometer recapture of Shirin van Anrooij.",
    "body_content": "Lorena Wiebes raced to yet another victory in a standout pro season, winning the elite women’s race at the gravel world championships Saturday.\nThe Dutchwoman outsprinted compatriot Marianne Vos to the finish line in Limburg, with Silvia Persico (Italy) taking the bronze medal.\nVos had appeared stronger than Wiebes during the race, putting her under pressure on the climbs, but the defending champion was no match for her in the sprint.\n“I’m super happy to take this world title,” Wiebes said. “The gravel scene is known for its individuality. It’s different from other international championships.\n“There are no selections; you have to qualify yourself to be allowed to participate. That makes it more individual.\n“If you enter the final and still have a chance at the world title, then you go for it.”\nThere was drama right until the end with Shirin van Anrooij looking poised for victory until the final kilometer. She attacked the select front group 12km from the finish line and opened a solid gap.\nThe chase was disjointed behind due to the presence of fellow Dutchwoman Wiebes, Vos and Yara Kastelijn, with Sylvia Persico (Italy) and Julia Kopecky (Czech Republic) being forced to do much of the chasing.\nVan Anrooij still had 14 seconds with 2km to go and seemed set for a huge win. However the Dutch allegiances were fluctuating throughout the race, with the team card being played at times but ignored at other moments.\nKastelijn threw any such allegiances out of the window towards the end and did a lot of chasing, prompting Van Anrooij’s recapture inside 400 meters to go.\nWiebes powered past her, opening up the gallop. While Vos was right on her wheel, she was unable to get past her and had to settle for silver. Persico was two seconds back for bronze, with Kastelijn, Van Anrooij and Kopecky the best of the rest.\nNumerical advantage for Dutch riders, but trade team loyalties also shape outcome\nVos, Wiebes and Persico on the podium (Photo: Dirk Waem / Belga Mag via AFP)\nVictorious last season, Vos returned to defend her title and fancied her chances on the 131km course. It featured 1,190 meters of climbing and constant undulations, but lacked the kind of big climbs that might have pitched it towards more specialist climbers.\nThe location in Limburg, the Netherlands saw a motivated Dutch turnout and they took control soon after the start. Wiebes began turning the screw with just over 70km remaining and thinned out the main bunch, with other Dutch riders also helping with the effort.\nFour of those moved clear inside the final 55km, with Vos, Wiebes, Maud Rijnbeek and Femke Gerritse going clear with Romy Kasper of Germany. They had an advantage of 40 seconds with 40km to go.\nVos was the strongest, pushing the pace on the climbs and reduced the front group to just herself and Wiebes with 22km to go. She knew the latter is the fastest sprinter in the peloton and did what she could to put her under pressure.\nBehind Persico attacked the chasers with 18km to go and bridged across to the leaders one kilometer later. She immediately moved to the front to try to keep the pace up.\nHowever the chasers rejoined almost immediately, with Van Anrooij, Kopecky, Femke De Vries and Reijanne Markus getting across.\nKastelijn joined them shortly after that and showed her climbing ability when she hammered up the Bronsdalweg climb with 15km to go.\nA decisive attack almost bears fruit\nVan Anrooij was devastated to be caught so close to the line (Photo: Dirk Waem / Belga Mag / Belga via AFP)\nThat effort temporarily gapped all bar Vos and Weibes, with Van Anrooij then making her own move 12km from the finish and opening a good gap. She still had 14 seconds with 2km to go but with Kastelijn and Kopecky working hard, she had just a slight advantage inside the final kilometer.\nThat was all Wiebes needed, with the 26 year old powering home ahead of Vos and Persico.\n“When Marianne Vos made her first attack, I was on the limit,” she admitted. “Luckily I could follow her on the climbs. I knew the last climb near Berg en Terblijt would be decisive and that I had to pace it well to avoid blowing up.\n“I was lucky that [SD Worx Protime teammate] Julia Kopecky was still with me. At one point, she came up to me and asked: ‘Can you win the sprint?’ I said with conviction: ‘Yes.’ So I had to finish it off for her.\n“Of course, I feel sorry for Shirin van Anrooij. But you don’t just give away a world title in the individual discipline that gravel is. I understand her disappointment. Hopefully, I can one day do something for her on the road at a European or world championship.\n“I’m looking forward to training next year in this beautiful jersey on the gravel.”\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nA post shared by TNT Sports Cycling (@tntsportscycling)",

    "body_content": "Norway’s Solveig Løvseth has won the 2025 Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii, with a time of 8:28:27. The 26-year-old former short-course specialist used a measured and balanced attack to move up throughout a sweltering day, despite this being her third-ever iron-distance event and first-ever Ironman World Championship attempt.\nLøvseth began the day with a 55:40 swim that had her exit the water in 14th place. Despite her lack of familiarity racing the distance, she patiently pushed her way through the field, breaking away from the large chase group around 45 miles into the bike in hopes of bridging up to the cyclists at the very front.\n2025 Ironman World Champion Solveig Løvseth rode from 14th place out of the water to third place into T2 off the bike. (Photo: Brad Kaminski)\nLøvseth would ride her way into third place by the end of the bike with a 4:31:53 bike split &#8211; the fastest of the day among finishers.\nIn front of Løvseth on the run, then-race leader Lucy Charles-Barclay would eventually succumb to the heat, withdrawing around mile 17 and requiring medical attention.\nOnly seven miles later, as Løvseth continued with her impeccable pacing, the new race leader, American Taylor Knibb would stop with only two miles to go, eventually being taken away in an ambulance, and the Norwegian would make the pass for first.\nSolveig Løvseth on the run at the 2025 Ironman World Championship in Kona. (Photo: Brad Kaminski/Triathlete)\nAs temperatures approached 90 degrees F in Kailua-Kona, Løvseth never faltered, moving with confidence all the way to breaking the tape on Ali’i Drive with a 2:55:47 run, joining other recent Ironman World Championship rookie winners like Chrissie Wellington (GBR) and Chelsea Sodaro (USA).\nNot far behind Løvseth, Great Britain’s Kat Matthews used a course run record (2:47:23) to close the gap throughout the final miles, but achingly fell 35 seconds short of the top podium step with a time of 8:29:02.\nThis would be Matthews’ first finish at the Hawaii Ironman World Championship after DNF’ing in 2023 and being unable to start in 2022 after a driver struck her with a truck during a pre-Kona training camp.\nRounding out the podium, 2024 Ironman World Championship Laura Philipp (DEU) finished in third with a time of 8:37:28.\nThe 2025 Ironman World Championship podium (L to R): third place Laura Philipp (DEU), winner Solveig Løvseth (NOR), and runner-up Kat Matthews (GBR).

I’m all alone now, so I might try to go with it.”\n“The run was really so hard from the start but I didn’t think I was going to get to the finish,” Løvseth said. “But I started to feel better around halfway.”\n“I’m really sorry for Taylor and Lucy,” Løvseth added, in regards to Lucy Charles-Barclay and Taylor Knibb faltering in the late stages of the race. “It’s not the way I wanted to pass either of them. I really hope they’re ok.\n“When I passed Taylor, I was thinking, ‘I actually have a chance.’”\n2025 Ironman World Championship Kona results\n\n\n\nName\nSwim\nBike\nRun\nFinish\n\n\n1.

    "item_subtitle": "Time to reexamine all you thought you knew.",
    "body_content": "It’s a week that makes you consider self-awareness and relationship dynamics. As Venus enters Libra and Pluto stations direct after months in retrograde, you remind yourself of the need for self-understanding, connection, and vulnerability. As the Sun squares Jupiter and opposes Chiron, you learn that there are certain aspects of healing that happen only in togetherness. Your weekly horoscope for October 12-18, 2025, helps you understand where to adjust your focus.\nWeekly Horoscope, October 12-18, 2025, Preview\nOctober 12 | Moon enters Cancer\nOctober 13 | Venus enters Libra; Pluto retrograde ends in Aquarius\nOctober 14 | Moon enters Leo\nOctober 17 | Sun in Libra opposite Chiron in Aries; Moon enters Virgo\nVenus Enters Libra\nIn astrology, each planet is partnered with a sign of the zodiac. These pairings hold a similar essence, intention, and medicine. For Venus, that pairing is Libra. Both Libra and Venus offer the frequency of love, beauty, partnership, and art. They invite connection and collaboration and hold the medicine of harmony and balance,  both inwardly and outwardly.\nOctober 13, 2025, brings the movement of Venus into Libra where she will remain until November 6, 2025. When Venus is in Libra, she thrives. This is where she becomes even more herself. Here her medicine becomes more available. These few weeks of Venus in Libra invite balanced exchange within each of your connections. It&#8217;s a time for playing with the beauty of connecting with the people in your life and simultaneously exploring what comes alive within you through these connections.\nIt&#8217;s time for appreciating beauty and also acknowledging that beauty itself can be medicine. Art, flowers, outdoors. Colors, shapes, textures. It&#8217;s time for noticing how your nervous system responds to these elements in life. It&#8217;s time for remembering yourself as art.\n(Illustration: mikroman6 | Getty )\nPluto Direct in Aquarius\nIt’s been five months since Pluto went retrograde. For our slower-moving outer planets, whose orbits are longer, the moment in between retrograde (perceived backward movement) and direct (forward movement) is drawn out in duration. Before moving ahead, it comes to a perceived standstill for close to two weeks in a sacred pause.\nDuring these two weeks, Pluto’s frequency saturates the field. This planet, its medicine, and its invitations are magnified. What you have been exploring, excavating, and transforming inwardly as relates to healing during Pluto retrograde invites integration. It&#8217;s time to witness how you have been allowing your mind to reorient its narratives and perspective.\nIt&#8217;s also a time to shift your focus from inward examination to outward transformation. Pluto direct is a whisper that the inner work of the last several months is ready to be healed and lived. As it stations direct on October 13, 2025, it allows you to move forward with themes of self-authority, liberation, and power dynamics in relationships and community in your everyday life.\nSun in Libra opposite Chiron Retrograde in Aries\nThe Sun in Libra simultaneously sits in opposition to Chiron retrograde in Aries on October 17, 2025. Whereas the Sun represents your identity, Chiron reveals your wounding. The sign of Libra represents another, Aries represents the self.\nOppositions act as mirrors, illuminating any aspects of yourself that feel in opposition—even in contradiction—to one another. On this day, you are offered a mirror to the many dynamics that contribute to who you are in relationship. It brings an honest look at the wounds you possess as well as the ones that you project onto one another—feeling too much, not enough, unseen, misunderstood, dismissed, overpowered.\nPerhaps your greatest growth can be found in connection. Here you mirror, trigger, activate, heal, and learn through one another. Self and other is a balancing act inherent to what it means to be human, and on this day, everything feels heightened. You might find your nervous system oscillating in between wanting to merge and pull away, to connect and to stand in your independence.\nAs with any opposition, you are invited to meet the middle ground. To honor your contradictions and hold your hurts. It is a day that allows for vulnerability, honesty, connection, and deeper understanding with yourself and your closest people. And it is a day to observe how you desire to hold your energy in relationships.\n(Illustration: Unknown)\nYour Weekly Horoscope, October 12-18, 2025\nThe transits in the days ahead highlight emotions and dynamics that you are ready to shift, including patterns and unconscious material that are ready to bring to your consciousness. This week reminds you that you cannot, and do not, exist in isolation. You need connection to each other and yourself—and you cannot have connection without vulnerability. Your weekly horoscope reminds you what it is that can help you do that with more ease.\nAries Rising\nOld patterns around self, connection, relationships, and belonging come to the surface this week. They&#8217;re a reminder that what arises does so only because you are ready to experience it with greater acceptance, compassion, and empowerment than in the past. Trust your ability to draw on that.\nTaurus Rising\nThe week invites you to bring ritual and routine into your days. It wants you to tend to yourself—your body, mind, and emotions. By offering yourself consistent and reliable support, all the shifting about to transpire this week can do so with greater ease.\nGemini Rising\nThe week highlights your worthiness and your right to take up space. To share your truth. To be seen. To belong. To hold your own perspectives and walk your own path. It is the kind of week that brings you even more of your own energy. All that remains is for you to embrace and embody it.\nCancer Rising\nIf you were to hold space for yourself, and not someone else, how would you do that? If you were reassuring yourself that you belong here, what would that look like? This week calls for this space holding and nurturing, but for your inner child, your inner teenager, and your inner adult.\nLeo Rising\nLet the world and other people be your mirror. Are you able to see what is being reflected to you? The more your mind can open, the more you will see old relationship dynamics and hurt that&#8217;s ready to be transformed and empowered. Before you can integrate what is actually true, you need to release what you believe to be true.\nVirgo Rising\nThe wisdom of your body, the worthiness of your body, the beauty of your body, and all that your body has been holding onto—these are the themes you are asked to explore. You are ready and resourced to meet these. Let yourself become Venus. Let yourself become yourself.\nLibra Rising\nThe way you carry yourself is shifting. This is a week to trust the change in how you want to move and hold yourself, how you desire to take up space, and how you choose to share your truth. Be aware of how you feel alone and how it responds when you are in the company of others. Let any expired relational dynamics fall away.\nScorpio Rising\nThere is much shifting within your emotional body—patterns ready to fall, emotions ready to be seen, dynamics ready to transform. As you navigate these changes, how can you embrace this space in between who you were and who you are becoming?\nSagittarius Rising\nYour mind is recycling old narratives into new perspectives, transforming old stories into empowered knowing, and bringing what has been unconscious into consciousness. As your mind changes, new ideals for your future begin to reveal themselves as old hurts around being seen in authentic expression are addressed.\nCapricorn Rising\nYour weekly horoscope asks you to ease into the ways you&#8217;ve been changing. You&#8217;re experiencing greater trust in your vision, safety in your body, and embodiment of your strength—and navigating each emotion that arises in response. Be aware of what comes up around worthiness and being seen, self-authority and connection, identity and inner safety.\nAquarius Rising\nYou&#8217;ve been transforming beneath the surface with your identity rearranging itself. Beginning this week, the inner is ready to become outer. Allow yourself permission to transform the way you hold, carry, and express yourself. Allow yourself grace to as you reorient your self-perception and identity, your narratives and belief systems.\nPisces Rising\nThis week nudges you toward more openness and intimacy regarding where you&#8217;re ready to be seen. It holds space for transformative honesty and healing of wounds around worthiness. It also brings shifts beneath the surface in your intuition and your emotional connection to the collective. Allow yourself to have that space, whether through journaling, walks outside, yoga, or meditation.",
